This project studies how the tone of financial and political news headlines affects daily stock market movements, focusing on the S&P 500 index. Many investors make decisions based on headlines, but this system adds structure by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to turn news into data-driven insights.

The system collects news headlines daily using the NewsData.io API and gathers S&P 500 data via yFinance. Headlines are cleaned, scored for sentiment (VADER), and emotions (NRCLex), and grouped into topics (LDA). A Random Forest model is trained on this data to predict if the market will go up or down the next day. Results are shared in a public dashboard built with Streamlit.
