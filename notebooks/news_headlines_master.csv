2025-06-25 10:00:00,Is the 30% Rule Unattainable in 2025? Typical U.S. Household Needs to Spend ~45% of Income to Afford the Median-priced Home,"Pittsburgh, Detroit, and St. Louis are the only affordable large metros, while buyers in Los Angeles potentially need to spend more than 100% of the median income on a homeAUSTIN, Texas, June 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In today's major housing markets, affordability isn't just strained, it's nearly extinct. According to a Realtor.com® Affordability Report, the typical U.S. household would need to spend 44.6% of their income to afford a median-priced home as of May 2025, well above the recommended 30% threshold. As high mortgage rates and home prices continue to weigh on affordability, only three of the top 50 metros are within financial reach for median-income earners: Pittsburgh, Detroit and St. Louis.""Earnings have risen, but homebuying costs have risen faster, which means that adhering to affordability guidelines can feel challenging if not impossible in many housing markets across the country,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""While a few Midwestern markets still offer a path to homeownership for the median-income household who can make a 20% down payment, in most large metros, the dream of owning a home remains out of financial reach without significant changes to either housing supply or interest rates.""Only Three Metros Pass the Affordability TestUsing a standard 20% down payment and May's average mortgage rate of 6.82%, just three major metros allow median-income earners to purchase a median-priced home without exceeding 30% of their income, Pittsburgh, Detroit and St. Louis.Metro AreaMay MedianListing PriceMonthly withTax & Ins.Annual MortgagePmt + Tax & Ins.2025 MedianHH IncomeShare ofIncomePittsburgh, PA$249,900$1,664$19,970$72,93527.4 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, MI$270,000$1,798$21,576$72,49329.8 %St. Louis, MO-IL$299,900$1,997$23,966$79,86930.0 %These metros remain attractive to both buyers and investors due to their relatively low home prices, but sustained demand for low-priced homes threatens to erode affordability even in these strongholds.""Detroit has always stood out for its affordability, and even with home prices rising, it remains one of the last major markets where median-income buyers still have a real shot at homeownership,"" said Anthony Djon, founder of Anthony Djon Luxury Real Estate. ""That said, demand is picking up fast – especially in the lower price points. First-time buyers are moving with urgency because they know the window to buy affordably is narrowing.""The Coasts are Out of ReachOn the opposite end of the spectrum, the share of income required to afford a home in California's largest metros far exceeds the national norm. The story of California's lack of affordability isn't new, though the degree to which it is unaffordable may still come as a surprise. As of May 2025, the typical home in Los Angeles requires more than 104% of the area's median income, meaning the average household would be unable to cover annual housing costs, even with zero spending on anything else. Other metros including San Diego, San Jose, New York, and Boston also saw affordability ratios well above 60%.Metro AreaMay MedianListing PriceMonthly withTax & Ins.Annual MortgagePmt + Tax & Ins.2025 MedianHH IncomeShare ofIncomeLos Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA$1,195,000$7,958$95,496$91,380104.5 %San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad, CA$995,000$6,626$79,513$103,06677.1 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA$1,419,500$9,453$113,436$156,66472.4 %New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ$795,000$5,294$63,531$94,96066.9 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH$879,000$5,854$70,243$109,29564.3 %That being said, perhaps, it doesn't come as a surprise that 51.0% of households in the Los Angeles area are renters, and just 49.0% of households own their own homes, compared to a homeownership rate of 65.1% nationally.What will Make America Affordable Again?There are a couple ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/06/n46090241/is-the-30-rule-unattainable-in-2025-typical-u-s-household-needs-to-spend-45-of-income-to-afford-th,business,

2025-06-25 09:59:26,"Buy now, pay later plans will soon impact your credit score—what you need to know","President Donald Trump doubled down on his assertion that U.S. bomb strikes destroyed Iran’s nuclear program. He criticized reporting on an initial U.S. intelligence report that suggested the bombings likely set Iran’s nuclear program back by a few months, not years.President Donald Trump on Wednesday doubled down on his claim that U.S. bomb strikes completely destroyed Iran’s nuclear program, and he bristled at the attention being paid to an initial American intelligence report that suggests otherwise.“It’s been obliterated, totally obliterated,” Trump said of the Iranian nuclear site at Fordo during a news conference, before he departed a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment, however, found that America’s airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites did not completely destroy those facilities.Rather, the U.S. bombings likely set Iran’s nuclear program back by a few months, not years, according to the assessment, which was first reported by CNN and matched by other outlets including NBC News.Trump on Wednesday acknowledged the existence of the Defense Intelligence Agency’s report, which has not been made public but has been described to journalists by people familiar with it. But he suggested the data that informed it was insufficient.“They did a report, but it was like, if you look at the dates, it’s just a few days after, so they didn’t see” the sites, Trump said.“The report was not a complete report,” he said.He added that the assessment said the damage from the U.S. attacks “may be very severe,” and complained that news outlets ignored that component in their reporting.The reporting undermines claims from Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the Saturday night strikes on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan sites had totally “obliterated” the country’s nuclear program. Trump says he’s ‘not happy’ as Israel and Iran both claim ceasefire violationsCan Germany afford a 5% NATO defense spending target?‘Fire up the deportation planes’: Trump official praises Supreme Court rulingIran attacks U.S. military base in Qatar with missilesTrump slams Russia’s Medvedev for saying countries will give Iran nuclear warheadsSenate to stay in DC until it passes Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ Thune saysU.S. intel found Iran didn’t move nuclear material from Fordo, Sen. Mullin saysLesser of two evils: Why China won’t mind a closure of the Strait of HormuzIran’s parliament backs blocking Strait of Hormuz. Its closure would alienate Tehran furtherThe White House angrily pushed back on the report. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the initial assessment “flat-out wrong” and slammed the “anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community” who leaked the report’s findings to the press.Hegseth piled on, saying in a statement Tuesday evening that “anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission.”The Pentagon has launched a “leak investigation” with the FBI, Hegseth said Wednesday. He also noted that the report was preliminary and was labeled “low confidence.”Speaking alongside Trump at the press conference, Hegseth criticized “fake news” and defended the strikes.“If you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you better get a big shovel and go really deep, because Iran’s nuclear program is obliterated,” he said.The White House also sent reporters a screenshot of a statement from Israel’s Atomic Energy Commission, declaring that the U.S. strike on Fordo “destroyed the site’s critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable.”The commission said that the combined strikes from the U.S. and Israel have “set back Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years.”Classified briefings for the House and Senate on the situation in Iran, initially set for Tuesday, were both abruptly delayed that same morning.The Senate briefing was reportedly rescheduled for Thursday and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said his chamber’s briefing will be held Friday.

FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue Tuesday as the company announced it had achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and will aim to trim another $1 billion in its upcoming fiscal year.The company achieved its “structural cost reduction target, in the face of ongoing headwinds,” CEO Raj Subramaniam said in a media release.“Looking ahead, I’m confident that our transformation initiatives, which are focused on integrating our networks and further reducing our cost-to-serve, will create meaningful long-term value,” he said.FedEx stock dropped about 5% in after-hours trading as the company offered current-quarter profit guidance that came in slightly below what Wall Street was expecting.As of Tuesday’s close, shares of FedEx had fallen more than 18% year to date.Here’s how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 compared with what analysts were anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $6.07 adjusted vs. $5.84 expected Revenue: $22.22 billion vs. $21.79 billion expectedFedEx reported its U.S. daily package volume was up 6% year over year.

2025-06-25 09:45:00,"How Tariffs Might Impact US Car Prices, By Brand","How Tariffs Might Impact US Car Prices, By Brand Tariffs on imported goods can have a wide ripple effect on prices, especially in the auto industry where supply chains are global, complex, and highly sensitive to cost changes.In this graphic, Visual Capitalist's Marcus Lu reveals how tariffs will impact U.S. car prices, assuming a flat 25% tariff is applied onto vehicles imported from outside North America.Data & DiscussionThe data for this visualization comes from Insurify, which projected price increases for various car brands based on their exposure to overseas manufacturing and parts.For models assembled within North America, the projections represent a 25% tariff on a model’s non-U.S. content and up to a 15% tariff discount of the total MSRP. Visit the official White House fact sheet to learn more.The analysis shows that Tesla, Jeep, and Honda will be the least affected by Trump’s auto tariffs, while Buick, Hyundai, and Kia will face the steepest price hikes.Buick’s Asia-Centric ProductionAlthough Buick is an American brand, the company produces many of its models in China and South Korea. As a result, Buick tops this list with a 22% projected price increase—the highest among all brands surveyed.This underscores how globalization has changed the footprint of even legacy U.S. nameplates. In fact, Buick is so big in China it has its own sub-brand.Hyundai and Kia Face High Tariff RisksOther vulnerable brands are Hyundai and Kia, each projected to see a 21–22% increase in vehicle prices. Though both brands have some manufacturing presence in the U.S., a significant portion of their models and components are still imported from South Korea.In late 2024, Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America opened in Georgia, which the company will use to build its U.S.-sold electric vehicles. The plant is capable of producing up to 500,000 vehicles per year.Tesla Is the Least AffectedTesla’s vertically integrated supply chain and domestic manufacturing help shield it from tariff risks. With most of its production based in the U.S.—particularly at its Fremont and Austin plants—Tesla’s vehicles are projected to increase in price by only 3% under new tariff rules.This minimal impact could give Tesla a competitive edge if other brands are forced to raise prices.

2025-06-25 10:00:00,What to do when success makes you lose touch with your identity,"Somewhere along the way, you learned how to read a room. How to anticipate what others needed before they said it. How to shape-shift just enough to stay admired, promoted, or simply safe. You became highly competent at adapting your identity, at being what the moment, the meeting, the mission demanded.And it worked. You delivered. You rose. You built a life of visible success.But lately, in the quiet spaces between the doing, something’s been stirring. A haunting whisper that asks: If I stop performing . . . who am I?This is the quiet cost of adaptation: achieving without anchoring, succeeding without a self.It’s more common than we talk about. Especially among high-performing professionals. In fact, more than half of U.S. postgraduate workers say their job is central to their identity. And in environments where productivity and performance are prized above all else, it’s easy to confuse your role with your worth.Eventually, the gap between the self we’ve curated and the self we’ve buried starts to ache. However, there’s good news. If the way you’ve adapted has left the core of you behind, you don’t have to forfeit the success you’ve achieved to rediscover yourself. The key is to learn how to “modulate”—adapt to meet the needs of those around you while still caring for yourself—versus “modify”—when you alter yourself to engineer outcomes that cost you your identity. Both can deliver near-term success, but modulating is sustainable. Modifying isn’t. That’s what Jason learned. The Story of Jason: A Master of AdaptationJason had always been the go-to guy. Smart, strategic, relational, he could manage up, down, and sideways without breaking a sweat. By 42, he was COO of a global tech firm. On paper, everything looked ideal.But in a coaching conversation with me one morning, he surprised himself with tears. “I’ve been everything to everyone,” he said quietly. “And now I’m not sure who I am. I know how to play any role. But I don’t know what’s real anymore.”His voice cracked. “I don’t think I’ve ever actually asked myself what I want.”Jason’s story isn’t rare. It’s the natural result of a system that rewards adaptation over authenticity, and of humans wired to belong at almost any cost.Why We Lose Our IdentitiesSeveral forces drive this invisible drift:1. Social Conditioning:From a young age, we’re praised for being compliant, easy, high-achieving. “You’re so mature,” someone says, because we didn’t cry when we needed to. “You’re such a leader,” someone notes, because we stepped in where others stepped back. We learn early that being attuned to others makes us valuable.2. A Need for Approval:Psychologically, we are wired to stay close to what feels safe. Children who sense that love is conditional learn to become highly adaptive. Adults carry those patterns forward, often unconsciously. In the workplace, this shows up as people who over-function, over-accommodate, or suppress parts of themselves to stay approved and feel validated.3. Professional Incentives:Organizations reward what’s visible: performance, productivity, polish. Authenticity, vulnerability, or questioning the game? Those are trickier. The SHRM research series found that 44% of U.S. employees feel burned out at work, with 45% feeling emotionally drained and 51% feeling “used up.” Even more disturbing, more than 15% of working-age adults globally experience anxiety or depression, often quietly, behind successful facades.The trouble isn’t that we adapted. It’s that we forgot we were doing it.Four Ways to Return to YourselfThe good news? The self you buried isn’t gone. It’s just been quiet. Here are four ways to begin the return.1. Notice the Cost of Over-AdaptationBegin by noticing the signs that something’s off. Do you feel hollow after high-achievement moments? Do you leave meetings unsure what you actually think or want? Do your days feel like performances strung together?Over-adaptation often comes with subtle burnout—not of energy, but of identity. The mask has grown heavy, but we’ve worn it so long, we think it’s our face.This is not a failure. It’s a signal.2. Track What Feels True (and What Doesn’t)Reclaiming yourself starts with paying attention to what resonates. What makes you feel more like you? What makes you shrink, go numb, or check out? What conversations, values, or people light something in you?Keep a simple “alignment journal” for a week. Jot down moments when you felt most like yourself, and least. Patterns will emerge. Your inner voice is quieter than your to-do list, but it’s still there. Listening is a practice.3. Create Spacious Identity, Not Just RolesIt’s easy to collapse our identity into our functions. “I’m a leader. I’m a parent. I’m a problem-solver.” But the self beneath roles is wider than any title.Ask: Who am I when no one is watching? What values do I hold when there’s nothing to gain? What would I say or do if I didn’t fear being misunderstood?In a world where 77% of workers have experienced burnout at their current job, according to research by Deloitte, choosing to explore identity outside of work isn’t indulgent, it’s essential.Building a spacious identity means allowing yourself to exist even when you’re not being productive or impressive. It’s messy, but it’s true.4. Practice Micro Acts of IntegrityReturning to yourself doesn’t require a grand reinvention. Start small.Speak up in a meeting when it’s easier to stay silent. Take an afternoon to do something that has no strategic value, only joy. Share honestly with a peer instead of defaulting to polished answers. Integrity isn’t perfection. It’s congruence. And every time you act in a way that matches your inner truth, you rebuild trust with yourself.It’s Not Too Late to ReturnYou adapted because you had to. Because it worked. Because it kept you safe or seen or successful. There’s no shame in that.But there comes a point when continuing the performance costs more than it gives. When the ladder you climbed leads not to joy, but to disorientation. And when the only real move left is inward.That’s what Jason did. He didn’t quit his job or retreat to the woods. He started smaller. He blocked off one hour a week, just for himself, with no agenda. He began journaling what felt true and what didn’t. He reached out to an old friend and admitted he wasn’t as “fine” as he seemed. He brought more curiosity into his leadership meetings, even when he didn’t have the answers. And slowly, the hollow places began to fill, not with more achievement, but with alignment.The good news? You don’t have to burn it all down. You don’t have to quit your job or find yourself on a mountaintop.You just have to start telling the truth. First to yourself. Then maybe to others.You can still be excellent. Still contribute, lead, and grow.But now, from the inside out.The self you thought you lost is waiting. Not to punish you, but to welcome you back.",fastcompany,https://www.fastcompany.com/91350133/regain-your-identity-without-losing-your-job?partner=rss,politics,

2025-06-25 09:30:00,Behind the Curtain: AI urgency calls for a modern Marshall Plan,"If politics and public debate were a rational, fact-based exercise, the government, business and the media would be obsessed with preparation for the unfolding AI revolution — rather than ephemeral outrage eruptions.Why it matters: That's not how Washington works. So while CEOs, Silicon Valley and a few experts inside government see AI as an opportunity, and threat, worthy of a modern Marshall Plan, most of America — and Congress — shrugs.One common question: What can we actually do, anyway?A lot. We've talked to scores of CEOs, government officials and AI executives over the past few months. Based on those conversations, we pieced together specific steps the White House, Congress, businesses and workers could take now to get ahead of the high-velocity change that's unspooling.None requires regulation or dramatic shifts. All require vastly more political and public awareness, and high-level AI sophistication.1. A global American-led AI super-alliance: President Trump, like President Biden before him, sees beating China to superhuman AI as an existential battle. Trump opposes regulations that would risk America's early lead in the AI race. Congress agrees.So lots of CEOs and AI experts are mystified about why Trump has alienated allies, including Canada and Europe, who could help form a super-alliance of like-minded countries that play by America's AI rules and strengthen our supply chain for vital AI ingredients like rare earth minerals.Imagine America, Canada, all of Europe, Australia, much of the Middle East, parts of Africa and South America — and key Asian nations like Japan, South Korea and India — all aligned against China in this AI battle. The combination of AI rules, supply-chain ingredients, and economic activity would form a formidable pro-American AI bloc.2. A domestic Marshall Plan: The Marshall Plan was America's commitment to rebuild Europe from the ruins of World War II. Now, the U.S. needs unfathomable amounts of data, chips, energy and infrastructure to produce AI. Trump has cut deals with companies and foreign countries — and cleared away some regulations — to expedite a lot of this. But there's been little sustained public discussion about what this means for the economy and U.S. jobs. It's very improvisational. Trump himself barely mentions AI or talks about it in any specificity in private.The country really needs ""a combination of the Marshall Plan, the GI Bill, the New Deal — the social programs and international aid efforts needed to make AI work for the U.S. domestically and globally,"" as Scott Rosenberg, Axios managing editor for tech, puts it. One smart idea: Get the federal government better aligned with states and even schools to prepare the country and workforce in advance. Some states — including Texas — are eagerly working with AI companies to meet rising demand in these new areas. Yet many others are sitting it out. Imagine all states exploiting this moment and refashioning post-high-school education and job training programs.In Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro — a possible Democratic presidential candidate in '28 — sees the opening. He hailed ""the largest private sector investment in Pennsylvania history"" earlier this month when he personally announced that Amazon Web Services plans to spend $20 billion on data center complexes in his state.3. A congressional kill switch: There's no appetite in Washington to regulate artificial intelligence, mainly out of fear China would then beat the U.S. to the most important technological advance in history.But that doesn't mean Congress needs to ignore or downplay AI's potential and risks.Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, got rich as an early investor in an earlier tech boom — cell phones — and has been one of Capitol Hill's few urgent voices on AI. ""If we're serious about outcompeting China,"" Warner told us, ""we need clear controls on advanced AI chips and strong investments in workforce training, research and development.""Several lawmakers and AI experts envision a preemptive move: Create a bipartisan, bicameral special committee, much like one stood up from the 1940s through the 1970s to monitor nuclear weapons. This committee, in theory, could do four things, all vital to advancing public (and congressional) awareness:Monitor, under top-secret clearance, the various large language models (LLMs) before they're released to fully understand their capabilities.Prepare Congress and the public, ahead of time, for looming effects on specific jobs or industries.Gain absolute expertise and fluency in the latest LLMs and AI technologies, and educate other members of Congress on a regular basis.Provide extra sets of eyes and scrutiny on models that pose risks of operating outside of human control in coming years. This basically creates another break-in-case-of-emergency lever beyond the companies themselves, and White House and defense officials with special top-secret clearance.4. A CEO AI surge: Anthropic's Dario Amodei told Axios that half of entry-level, white-collar jobs could be gone in a few years because of AI. Almost every CEO tells us they're slowing or freezing hiring across many departments, where AI is expected to displace humans. CEOs, better educated on AI, could help workers in two big ways:Provide deep instruction, free access and additional training to help each person use AI to vastly increase proficiency and productivity. This retraining/upskilling effort would be expensive, but a meaningful way for well-off people and organizations to show leadership.Get more clever leaders thinking now about new business lines AI might open up, creating jobs in new areas to make up for losses elsewhere. A few CEOs suggested they see a social obligation to ease the transition, especially if government fails to act.Go deeper: ""Wake-up call: Leadership in the AI age,"" by Jim VandeHei.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/25/ai-united-states-government-plan,politics,

2025-06-25 09:05:02,Kennedy-appointed CDC vaccine panel says it will scrutinize the childhood vaccine schedule,"Bumble shares rallied after the company said it plans to lay off 30% of its workforce, or about 240 roles. The dating app maker estimates that the reductions will help it save $40 million annually. Founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who stepped down as CEO at the beginning of 2024, returned to the role earlier this year.Bumble shares rallied 25% on Wednesday after the dating app company revealed in a securities filing that it intends to slash 30% of its workforce, or about 240 roles.The layoffs will result in $13 million to $18 million in charges for the company hitting in the third and fourth quarters of this year. Management estimates that the reductions will help the company save $40 million annually.A Bumble spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that the layoffs were “not made lightly.”“Our focus now is on moving forward in a way that strengthens our core business, continues to serve our members effectively, and positions us for future growth,” they wrote.Bumble said the cuts are part of a reconfiguration of its “operating structure to optimize execution on its strategic priorities.” The company plans to invest savings into new product and technology development.Shares of the dating app company have plunged since their debut on the public markets in 2021.

2025-06-25 09:00:00,"A decade after Obergefell, LGBTQ+ rights remain under threat","It's been ten years since the Supreme Court's landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision legalized same-sex marriage across the U.S. But Jim Obergefell, the case's lead plaintiff, says the fight is far from over — marriage equality remains under threat.The big picture: Five months into Trump 2.0, LGBTQ+ communities are facing a surge in political and legal challenges. Still, advocates and individuals are drawing strength from a long history of resilience — and fighting back through court challenges, community gatherings and celebrations of Pride.But Obergefell says the current political climate casts a shadow over the 10th anniversary of marriage equality.""Never did I expect in 10 years that I would be worried about Obergefell being overturned, that I would be worried about the loss of marriage equality, that I would be worried about so many rights being taken away,"" Obergefell told Axios. ""While it's something to celebrate that we've made it to 10 years, it's just wrong that we're worried about it making it to 11.""Zoom in: In recent years, anti-LGBTQ+ bills have flooded statehouses, and President Trump's victory has emboldened the GOP's anti-trans blitz. Shannon Minter, the National Center for LGBTQ Rights' legal director who served as lead counsel in a landmark California marriage equality case, said he's never seen a moment of such ""intense, comprehensive, vicious backlash"" against the community.Jenny Pizer, the chief legal officer at Lambda Legal and a driving force in the fight for marriage equality, hears the ""devastating echoes of past attacks"" today. But the ""magnitude and the speed"" of the administration's actions makes this moment singular.At the same time, corporations are going quiet.Amid corporate America's widespread walk-backs of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, a number of prominent businesses pulled support from 2025 Pride events.Between the lines: The Respect for Marriage Act, which President Biden signed into law in 2022, ensures federal recognition of same-sex and interracial marriage. But it does not prohibit states from taking steps to ban or restrict same-sex marriage if Obergefell were overturned.Minter says he does not foresee the decision being directly reversed, but he fears attempts to undermine the full scope of marriage equality, leading toward the kind of ""skim milk"" marriage the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned about in the Windsor case.Pizer notes, ""our Supreme Court right now is more conservative than it's been in a very, very long time."" And she sees the Dobbs decision as evidence the high court is ""willing to defy what the American people want based on legal arguments that many of us think are completely specious.""What he's saying: ""Even if it doesn't happen, we need to be active,"" Obergefell said. ""We need to be involved in fighting to protect it, fighting to protect all the progress we've made in this country for civil and human rights.""Zoom out: Even as these challenges mount, LGBTQ+ visibility and influence are rising nationwide. The number of U.S. households headed by same-sex married couples jumped from 425,357 to 774,553 from 2015 to 2023, per Census data cited by Pew Research Center.The number of elected officials who identify as LGBTQ+ has nearly tripled since 2017. In 2025, Sarah McBride became the first openly transgender member of Congress, representing Delaware.LGBTQ+ leaders have served in Cabinet-level roles under both Biden and Trump, and several states have elected LGBTQ+ governors, representatives or senators.By the numbers: A decade since the decision, a steady majority of Americans support same-sex marriage. In July 2015, 58% of U.S. adults said marriages between same-sex couples should be recognized by the law as valid and with the same rights as heterosexual marriages, according to Gallup polling. By May 2025, that share had grown to 68%.Recent polling from a trio of firms on behalf of Centerline Liberties and Project Right Side found that even a majority of Republicans (56%) agree with the right to marry when a neutral option was not provided.Data from the Redbud Consulting, Echelon Insights and National Research survey found that many people's growing support for same-sex marriage is ""primarily driven by personal interactions with gay friends, family, and neighbors.""But with progress, ""backlash is a given,"" Obergefell said. As he did a decade ago, he keeps fighting — for the civil rights trailblazers who came before him, for the LGBTQ+ kids growing up in small towns across the country, and for his late husband John Arthur, whose love inspired historic progress.""In 10 years, I don't want there to be a need for any organizations fighting for equality, fighting for rights,"" he says.

2025-06-25 09:00:00,"Exclusive: Thune urges ""light touch"" on AI regulations","Senate Majority Leader John Thune expects some form of freeze on state AI regulations to remain in the ""big, beautiful bill"" — even as his Republicans keep debating the move.Why it matters: States are leading the way in passing and implementing AI guardrails while Congress lags behind, and consumers say they want regulation.The moratorium has been criticized but Thune's (R-S.D.) support for it falls in line with the number one priority among many Republicans in Washington: don't get in the way of innovation. The big picture: ""We want to be the leaders in AI and quantum and all these new technologies. And the way to do that is not to come in with a heavy hand of government, it's to come in with a light touch,"" Thune said. As former chair of the Senate Commerce committee, it's a space he knows well.The ""big, beautiful bill"" makes broadband grants contingent on states not pursuing AI regulations for the next 10 years.""I think there'll be some version of it in the bill, but... it's possible, based on kind of the feedback we're getting from members, that it might change in some way,"" he said.Zoom in: Asked how Congress can know what policies will work 10 years down the line with a technology evolving as quickly as AI, Thune responded frankly, ""I don't think you can.""""I think this is the kind of thing where you can put some basic sort of parameters in place, but you're going to have to come along and be able to tweak those in the future, too,"" he said.Asked if the temporary ban on state AI regulations could tie the hands of states for the next decade, Thune responded, ""that's the question, I think, that everybody's trying to answer.""The way it's written now would derail a host of bills across the country addressing everything from deceptive election materials to autonomous vehicles. Behind the scenes: Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had a heated debate over the issue during a closed-door meeting Monday night, as Axios reported.Asked about Blackburn's pushback on Tuesday, Cruz told Axios: ""The provision is in the bill, and it's going to remain in the bill.""The policy has already undergone a rebrand, being framed as a ""temporary pause"" instead of a ""moratorium.""It has received the green light from the Senate parliamentarian after Cruz tweaked it slightly, but is still facing fierce opposition on and off the Hill, ranging from populist Republican leaders like Steve Bannon to civil-rights advocates.""I'm willing to take this up on the floor if need be, and hopefully we can address it before then,"" Sen. Josh Hawley said Tuesday. ""I think it's terrible policy. It's a huge giveaway to some of the worst corporate actors out there.""Friction point: Cruz, chair of the Commerce committee, which has key jurisdiction on AI issues, has said he's only interested in light-touch regulation for AI.And Congress has shown it can't figure tech regulation out: ""The challenge all of the states have is that getting anything through Congress in a reasonable length of time has become extremely difficult, right?"" Sen. Mike Rounds, who was a key part of the bipartisan AI workshops last year, told Axios. ""But the long term development of AI will require that we have a consistent policy throughout the United States.""What to watch: Thune has worked on a bipartisan AI bill with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in the past, and told Axios that ""at some point, I'm hoping we will legislate on this issue.""""I think there are enough equities that both sides have in this,"" he said.Maria Curi contributed to this story.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/25/thune-ai-moratorium-big-beautiful-bill,politics,

2025-06-25 09:00:00,Scoop: Trump admin cuts contracts with scientific publishing giant,"The Trump administration has terminated millions worth of funding for Springer Nature, a German-owned scientific publishing giant that has long received payments for subscriptions from National Institutes of Health and other agencies, Axios has learned.Why it matters: President Trump and MAGA have made a push to target academic institutions as well as research organizations perceived to be the source of so-called ""woke"" ideology, including DEI and gender-affirming care policies, by withholding federal funding and in some cases initiating legal action.State of play: Earlier this year, the Justice Department sent a letter to a Springer publication questioning its editorial practices and accusing the publishing house of acting as a partisan in scientific debates, as well as wrongfully advocating for positions, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. The letter also posed questions about Springer's alleged ties to China, CCP funding and related claims of censorship.At least one other scientific journal, Chest, also received a letter about taking sides in scientific debates, as the Washington Post reported in April. Springer Nature has more than 3,000 journals and publications, and its portfolio includes Nature and Scientific American. The editorial content ranges from science and medical news to peer-reviewed research papers written by scientists. The company went public last October.Prior to the administrative action, Donald Trump Jr. had tweeted ""No more taxpayer money for woke publishers!"" linking to a Breitbart story about possible cuts to government-funded subscriptions for scientific and medical journals. About $20 million in grants covering subscriptions have been cut, with billions more being evaluated, according to the source.Springer Nature declined to comment. Spokespersons for the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to requests for comment.Zoom out: Over the last year, Springer Nature has issued hundreds of retractions of faulty research that it published in open access journals due to compromised peer-reviewed processes and other quality and reliability concerns. The company this month announced a new transparent peer review process for research papers accepted for publication in Nature.

2025-06-25 08:30:00,"Israeli intelligence sees ""significant"" damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, officials say","Israeli intelligence services believe U.S. and Israeli strikes caused ""very significant"" damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, with some officials perplexed by a leaked U.S. intelligence report that suggested otherwise.Like the U.S., Israel has not produced a final assessment on how far back the bombing campaign has set Iran's nuclear program, three officials told Axios.Why it matters: The emerging Israeli assessment presents a far more optimistic view of the operation than a preliminary report from the Defense Intelligence Agency, which assessed the strikes may have set Iran back only a few months.President Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear program has been ""obliterated"" came under scrutiny Tuesday after the DIA report was leaked to CNN, the New York Times, Washington Post and multiple other outlets.The leak infuriated the White House, which rejected the findings as ""fake news"" and accused anonymous officials of seeking to undermine Trump.The big picture: Israel, which initiated the war and faces a far more direct threat from Iran than the U.S., is largely satisfied with the early results from Trump's military strike on Saturday.""A professional battle damage assessment takes time,"" an Israeli official stressed, suggesting it was far too soon to draw the kinds of conclusions included in the DIA report.""Israeli intelligence services haven't arrived at any bottom lines for now,"" the official added. ""But we don't think there was any bug in the operation, and we have no indications the bunker-buster bombs didn't work. Nobody here is disappointed.""Between the lines: The classified DIA report was based on early intelligence from just one agency, and the overall picture remains muddled — especially with Iran itself still assessing the damage and weighing its next moves.Still, the existence of the report — paired with the abrupt postponement of congressional briefings on Tuesday — has ignited deep frustration among Democrats over Trump's cavalier approach to sensitive intelligence.""I'm very concerned about [Trump] distorting, manipulating and even lying about intelligence,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told Axios. ""We've been here before. We went to war in Iraq under false pretenses.""The other side: Trump and his aides have doubled down on the success of the B-2 bombing operation and lashed out at the media for reporting on the early intelligence assessment.""Leaking that type of information — whatever the information, whatever side it comes out on — is outrageous. It's treasonous,"" White House envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News.""We put 12 bunker-buster bombs on Fordow,"" Witkoff continued, referring to Iran's most fortified underground nuclear site. ""There's no doubt that it breached the canopy ... and there's no doubt that it was obliterated."" Screenshot via Truth SocialBehind the scenes: Israeli officials said the Iranian government has been engaged in its own battle damage assessment to determine the state of its nuclear program.An Israeli official with direct knowledge of intelligence on Iran told Axios that intercepted communications suggest Iranian military officials have been giving false situation reports to the country's political leadership — downplaying the extent of the damage.""The Iranians themselves still don't even have a clear idea what happened to some of their nuclear facilities,"" a second Israeli official said.Zoom in: Israeli officials said the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities in Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan — the three sites targeted in the U.S. strike on Saturday — is ""very significant.""At Natanz, the above-ground enrichment facility was completely destroyed, and signs point to the collapse of its underground infrastructure, an Israeli official said.At Fordow, the U.S. military's 30,000-pound bunker-busters inflicted major damage on the facility — though Israeli officials say it remains unclear whether the underground areas suffered full structural collapse.At Isfahan, Israeli officials said the uranium reprocessing facility — which produces the uranium metal used in bomb-making — was destroyed. Isfahan's underground tunnels were also damaged, but the full scope is still being assessed.""We doubt that these facilities can be activated any time in the near future,"" an Israeli official said.The intrigue: Two Israeli officials also claimed that intelligence shows Iran's stockpile of 60% and 20% enriched uranium is now buried beneath rubble at Isfahan and Fordow — and it's unclear whether Iran will be able to recover it in the near future.Zoom out: Beyond the direct damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, Israeli officials say the broader war effort dealt a crippling blow to Iran's long-term nuclear capabilities.Israel assassinated dozens of A-list and B-list nuclear scientists — key figures with both institutional memory and hands-on expertise — during the 12-day conflict.Several of Iran's centrifuge production lines were destroyed, significantly limiting the country's ability to replace the thousands of centrifuges lost in the Israeli and U.S. airstrikes.The IDF also destroyed labs and testing facilities that housed scientific equipment critical to Iran's nuclear weapons research and development, according to an Israeli official.The bottom line: ""When you put all that together, there is a serious cumulative effect,"" the Israeli official said.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/25/iran-nuclear-program-israel-damage-intelligence,politics,

2025-06-25 08:30:00,Aging entrepreneurs face new policy hurdles. Here’s how to help,"Americans love small businesses. We dedicate a week each year to applauding them, and spend Small Business Saturday shopping locally. Yet hiding in plain sight is an enormous challenge facing small-business owners as they age: retiring with dignity and foresight. The current economic climate is making this even more difficult.As a professor who studies aging and business, I’ve long viewed small-business owners’ retirement challenges as a looming crisis. The issue is now front and center for millions of entrepreneurs approaching retirement. Small enterprises make up more than half of all privately held U.S. companies, and for many of their owners, the business is their retirement plan.But while owners often hope to finance their golden years by selling their companies, only 20% of small businesses are ready for sale even in good times, according to the Exit Planning Institute. And right now, conditions are far from ideal. An economic stew of inflation, supply chain instability, and high borrowing costs means that interest from potential buyers is cooling.For many business owners, retirement isn’t a distant concern. In the U.S., baby boomers—who are currently 61 to 79 years old—own about 2.3 million businesses. Altogether, they generate about $5 billion in revenue and employ almost 25 million people. These entrepreneurs have spent decades building businesses that often are deeply rooted in their communities. They don’t have time to ride out economic chaos, and their optimism is at a 50-year low.New policies, new challengesYou can’t blame them for being gloomy. Recent policy shifts have only made life harder for business owners nearing retirement. Trade instability, whipsawing tariff announcements and disrupted supply chains have eroded already thin margins. Some businesses—generally larger ones with more negotiating power—are absorbing extra costs rather than passing them on to shoppers. Others have no choice but to raise prices, to customers’ dismay. Inflation has further squeezed profits.At the same time, with a few notable exceptions, buyers and capital have grown scarce. Acquirers and liquidity have dried up across many sectors. The secondary market, a barometer of broader investor appetite, now sees more sellers than buyers. These are textbook symptoms of a “flight to safety,” a market shift that drags out sale timelines and depresses valuations—all while Main Street business owners age out. These entrepreneurs typically have one shot at retirement, if any.Adding to these woes, many small businesses are part of what economists call regional “clusters,” providing services to nearby universities, hospitals, and local governments. When those anchor institutions face budget cuts—as is happening now—small-business vendors are often the first to feel the impact.Research shows that many aging owners actually double down in weak economic times, sinking increasing amounts of time and money in a psychological pattern known as “escalating commitment.” The result is a troubling phenomenon scholars refer to as “benign entrapment.” Aging entrepreneurs can remain attached to their businesses not because they want to, but because they see no viable exit.This growing crisis isn’t about bad personal planning; it’s a systemic failure.Rewriting the playbook on small-business policyA key mistake that policymakers make is to lump all small-business owners together into one group. That causes them to overlook important differences. After all, a 68-year-old carpenter trying to retire doesn’t have much in common with a 28-year-old tech founder pitching a startup. Policymakers may cheer for high-growth “unicorns,” but they often overlook the “cows and horses” that keep local economies running.Even among older business owners, circumstances vary based on local conditions. Two retiring carpenters in different towns may face vastly different prospects based on the strength of their local economies. No business, and no business owner, exists in a vacuum. Relatedly, when small businesses fail to transition, it can have consequences for the local economy. Without a buyer, many enterprises will simply shut down. And while closures can be long-planned and thoughtful, when a business closes suddenly, it’s not just the owner who loses. Employees are left scrambling for work. Suppliers lose contracts. Communities lose essential services.Four ways to help aging entrepreneursThat’s why I think policymakers should reimagine how they support small businesses, especially owners nearing the end of their careers.First, small-business policy should be tailored to age. A retirement-ready business shouldn’t be judged solely by its growth potential. Rather, policies should recognize stability and community value as markers of success. The U.S. Small Business Administration and regional agencies can provide resources specifically for retirement planning that starts early in a business’s life, to include how to increase the value of the business and a plan to attract acquirers in later stages.Second, exit infrastructure should be built into local entrepreneurial ecosystems. Entrepreneurial ecosystems are built to support business entry (think incubators and accelerators) but not for exit. In other words, just like there are accelerators for launching businesses, there should be programs to support winding them down. These could include confidential peer forums, retirement-readiness clinics, succession matchmaking platforms, and flexible financing options for acquisition.Third, chaos isn’t good for anybody. Fluctuations in capital gains taxes, estate tax thresholds, and tariffs make planning difficult and reduce business value in the eyes of potential buyers. Stability encourages confidence on both sides of a transaction.And finally, policymakers should include ripple-effect analysis in budget decisions. When universities, hospitals or governments cut spending, small-business vendors often absorb much of the shock. Policymakers should account for these downstream impacts when shaping local and federal budgets.If we want to truly support small businesses and their owners, it’s important to honor the lifetime arc of entrepreneurship—not just the launch and growth, but the retirement, too.Nancy Forster-Holt is a clinical associate professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Rhode Island.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

After the Senate unveiled a bill Tuesday to write the “crypto rules of the road,” Senator Cynthia Lummis, who heads the Senate Banking subcommittee on digital assets, spoke with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday to break down the details of new legislation. She said the U.S. should be a leader in crypto rulemaking, and noted that rules of the road for digital assets already exist in some markets overseas.Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange went to bat for the planned crypto ETF from President Trump’s Truth Social, asking for a rule change to allow the bitcoin and ethereum ETF to launch. If approved by the SEC within the next 90 days, it would further Trump’s push into digital assets.Finally, Crypto World spoke with Yuval Rooz, CEO of Digital Asset, which raised $135 million in a fundraising announced on Tuesday, a round backed by major names in banking and finance, including Goldman Sachs and Citadel Securities.

2025-06-25 15:25:00,"BIS Claims Stablecoins Fail As Money, Calls For Strict Limits On Their Role","BIS Claims Stablecoins Fail As Money, Calls For Strict Limits On Their Role Authored by Amin Haqshanas via CoinTelegraph.com,A new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) challenged the notion that stablecoins can serve as money in a modern financial system.According to the BIS Annual Economic Report 2025, stablecoins fail the fundamental tests of “singleness,” “elasticity” and “integrity,” three critical criteria that define effective monetary instruments.The BIS described stablecoins as “digital bearer instruments” that resemble financial assets more than actual money. “Stablecoins perform poorly when assessed against the three tests for serving as the mainstay of the monetary system,” the report said.Unlike central bank-backed money, which is accepted “at par” and requires no background checks, private entities issue stablecoins and often trade at fluctuating rates. This undermines the core principle of monetary singleness, the report claimed.Stablecoins continue to grow, but volatility remains. Source: BISStablecoins fail elasticity and integrity testsElasticity, the second test, is crucial for absorbing shocks and meeting large-value payment demands, BIS said in its report.It pointed out that “any additional supply of stablecoins thus requires full upfront payment by its holders,” likening it to a “strict cash-in-advance setup” that contrasts with the flexibility of modern banking systems, where central banks provide liquidity as needed.The third and perhaps most damning failure lies in the area of integrity. The report claimed that stablecoins’ design, especially those transacted via unhosted wallets on public blockchains, makes them prone to financial crime.“Stablecoins have significant shortcomings when it comes to promoting the integrity of the monetary system,” the BIS noted, emphasizing their vulnerability to money laundering, sanctions evasion and terrorist financing.Cross-border use of stablecoins has been rising. Source: BISStablecoins should have a limited roleWhile acknowledging the continued demand for stablecoins due to features like cross-border accessibility and lower transaction costs, the BIS argued that they should only play a limited, well-regulated role.“Society can re-learn the historical lessons about the limitations of unsound money,” the report cautioned. “Bold action by central banks and other public authorities can push the financial system along the right path, in partnership with the financial sector.”Circle, the company behind USDC, saw its stock drop more than 15% on Tuesday after the BIS report, hitting $222. CRCL shares had reached an all-time high of $299 on Monday.Despite its hard take on stablecoins, the BIS report praised tokenization as a “transformative innovation” for the next-generation monetary and financial system. It said tokenization builds on the current financial system rather than replacing it.Some in the crypto community said it is “no surprise” that the BIS paper was generally negative on stablecoins, given that it is a “regulatory body owned by global central banks.”“The BIS is hysterical in its opposition to crypto,” Jim Walker, chief economist at Aletheia Capital, wrote. “The first criterion, backed by a central bank, should make it a laughing stock given the historical failures of those institutions around the world.” Tyler DurdenWed, 06/25/2025 - 11:25",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/bis-claims-stablecoins-fail-money-calls-strict-limits-their-role,business,

2025-06-25 15:30:27,Fox News' racist smears against Zohran Mamdani fail in New York mayoral race,"New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the Democratic primary on Tuesday night, while his chief rival, disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, conceded. The final results will be determined after a ranked-choice count of the votes, with results expected next Tuesday, but the race has nevertheless been a major upset against not only the Democratic establishment but also the right-wing media empire of billionaire Rupert Murdoch.Mamdani’s path to the Democratic nomination appears to be secure, and he will likely be the party’s nominee in November’s general election, where the Democratic nominee is traditionally a heavy favorite to win.Cuomo had the support of former President Bill Clinton, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, and many influential figures in New York City’s Democratic establishment, despite Cuomo resigning the governorship in disgrace over allegations of serial sexual misconduct and his alleged cover-up of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. A super PAC tied to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire, also spent over $25 million to bolster Cuomo.xDatawrapper ContentFox News, which is owned by Murdoch, added in to the headwinds facing Mamdani, a leftist who ran on a platform of fixing the city’s unaffordability crisis. The right-wing network barraged Mamdani with bigoted attacks over his Muslim faith—a frequent move for Murdoch’s media empire.For instance, on the June 17 edition of “The Five” panel discussion show, co-host Greg Gutfeld described Mamdani as a “social justice suicide bomber.” He added, “If this guy even gets close to being elected, dude, you're going to see this go to hell.”On Tuesday night, Fox host Sean Hannity, a confidante of President Donald Trump, said Mamdani was an “anti-Israel radical who truly believes in globalizing the intifada.”The New York Post, which Murdoch also owns, was also openly bigoted in its opposition to Mamdani.Mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks to supporters during a Democratic primary watch party on June 24 in New York.On Monday, the paper whined that Mamdani supports providing funds for gender-affirming care for transgender people, a topic the right has tried to demonize to motivate socially conservative voters.That story was accompanied by an op-ed by the Post’s editorial board, in which it instructed New York voters to “vote against the menace that is Zohran Mamdani.”While not a part of Murdoch’s empire, The New York Times was also hostile to Mamdani’s candidacy. While the outlet recently claimed it would no longer make local endorsements, a June 16 op-ed offered “advice to voters,” calling Mamdani’s progressive platform “worrisome” and “damaging to city life.”“We do not believe that Mr. Mamdani deserves a spot on New Yorkers’ ballots,” The Times concluded.However, Democratic voters appear to have rejected the Murdoch media machine and the Times’ handwringing. They rewarded Mamdani with their support after he repeatedly hammered his plans to tackle the city’s steep cost of living, including with a program of free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and rent freezes for many tenants, among numerous other policies. Additionally, he received the backing of progressive icons like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Despite the ugliest smears of Trump’s strongest media ally, Mamdani won the night by standing up for what he believes in—and he is well on his way to becoming mayor of New York City.Campaign Action",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/6/25/2330018/-Fox-News-racist-smears-fail-in-New-York-mayoral-race,politics,

2025-06-25 14:57:12,"Zohran Mamdani has NYC's business community ""terrified""","New York City business leaders woke up to the outcome they least expected Wednesday morning — young, popular socialist Zohran Mamdani cruising to apparent victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary.Why it matters: There's a reason Kathryn Wylde, long the voice of the city's business community, said this week that leaders were ""terrified"" of Mamdani's rise.For Wall Street, it's not just about Mamdani — some fear a broader rise of socialism could destabilize markets and the economy.Zoom out: Bradley Tusk, CEO of Tusk Ventures and former campaign manager for Michael Bloomberg's 2009 mayoral race, said investors need to watch for a rise of ""demagogues"" on either side of the political spectrum.""If you have a super high profile socialist mayor creating all types of new government entitlements, taxes, you know, big anti-capitalism sort of campaign...that reverberates everywhere and that generally puts pressure on markets,"" Tusk told Axios.Zoom in: Tusk pointed to what he sees as a rise in ""very, very progressive mayors,"" citing Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu as examples, albeit with mixed track records. Johnson's approval has been at a record low for the office, while voters view Wu much more favorably. What they're saying: Jim Bianco, president and macro strategist at Bianco Research, wrote ""it appears that NYC is electing to commit suicide by Mayor"" in a post on X.One well-known investor deleted an X post suggesting Mamdani's win was a nightmare for billionaire investors, name-checking the Bloombergs, Ackmans, and Loebs of the world.The intrigue: ""Wall Street South,"" the movement of financial firms to Florida from New York, was already gaining traction, particularly after Ken Griffin relocated Citadel's headquarters to Miami.Tusk warned that, while unlikely, New York could go the way of ""once very prosperous"" cities like ""Detroit and Baltimore...that had really big tax bases and then...got dirty and dangerous and the taxes went up too much and people left.""After the results, Tusk added in an email that ""There's a lot about Zohran Mamdani we still don't know but there's a very good chance he will be our next mayor and if you love this city, you'll do what you can to help him succeed.""Reality check: The ""people will flee"" reaction is nothing new in NYC.When progressive candidate Bill de Blasio ran to replace Michael Bloomberg in 2013, investors were concerned about him raising income taxes on the top 1% of earners, a push that hit a wall in Albany. De Blasio met with a slew of industry leaders, like former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and Rupert Murdoch, to ease industry concerns ahead of the election. It appeared to work.

SB 1318 also adds a new Section 15.501, which restricts non-competes for dentists, nurses, and physician assistants. SB 1318 goes into effect September 1, 2025, and applies to agreements entered into or renewed on and after that day. Here are the five key things to know about the new law:1. The “Reasonable Price” Buyout Standard Has ChangedPreviously, Texas law required that physician non-compete agreements include a buyout provision at a “reasonable price,” often leading to disputes and uncertainty over what constituted “reasonable.” SB 1318 replaces this standard with a clear cap. Now, the buyout amount cannot exceed the physician’s total annual salary and wages at the time of termination. This change eliminates the prior option to arbitrate the buyout price.2. New Time and...

2025-06-25 14:30:12,The Senate majority runs through moderate America,"Many of you are going to hate this, but if Democrats have any shot at reclaiming the Senate next year, it’ll happen through the party’s moderate flank.I get it. I know some of you are still annoyed over my piece warning that we can’t afford to lose young men to conservatism. One commenter summed up the backlash: “[Kos] used to stand up for our values. Him suggesting we now adjust them to cater to the right is new. And it sucks.”But let’s be clear: There’s a difference between catering to the right and doing what we need to win elections while staying true to our core values. Purity politics will keep us in the minority. If the left-left wants to win on the strength of its agenda, it has a long way to go in winning over hearts and minds.A new Echelon Insights poll makes this clear. Asked what kind of party they’d want if the two major parties disappeared, only 6% of likely voters would support a party with a Green New Deal-style agenda focused on ending systemic inequality, breaking up corporations, and promoting full economic and social justice.Another 13% would support a party that “advance[s] social progress including women's rights and LGBTQ rights, work[s] with other countries through free trade and diplomacy, cut[s] the deficit, and reform[s] capitalism with sensible regulation.” That’s fairly center-left.But the best-performing left-of-center message? A middle-class focus—universal health insurance, stronger labor unions, and higher taxes on the rich to help the less well-off. That scored 31% support. It’s not a majority, but it’s stronger than either of the two conservative-aligned options, which together totaled 44%.xDatawrapper ContentSure, we can quibble with question wording, but the trend is clear: People support equality in theory, but they want politicians focused on their lives. That means better wages (which unions deliver), affordable housing, cheaper groceries, accessible education, and a shot at the American dream. When 75% of men say they won’t do better than their parents, it’s no surprise they’re angry.Yes, racism is baked into conservative appeal. But maybe that tops out around the 44% of voters drawn to conservative messaging. Republicans can’t win national elections or hold Congress with 44%. The Senate map for the 2026 midterm elections looks rough on paper. Democrats will defend open seats in swingy Michigan, light-blue New Hampshire, and lean-red Georgia. Meanwhile, Republicans have to defend only Maine and North Carolina. In a typical year, Democrats might gain a seat (or lose one)—nowhere near the four they need to flip for a majority.But next year won’t be typical. Trump’s Republicans are self-sabotaging with their unpopular “Big Beautiful Bill,” which will likely tank them in the House. Still, the Senate is all but surely out of reach.Democrats’ next-best pickup targets after Maine and North Carolina? Florida and Texas. That’s how bleak it is. To retake the chamber, Democrats would need to miraculously win all four of those states and hold every vulnerable seat.Dan Osborn, who ran an independent challenge against Republican Sen. Deb Fischer last year, chats with patrons of a brewery in Beatrice, Nebraska in July 2024.Enter the much-maligned “moderates.”Last year, political newcomer Dan Osborn ran as an independent in deep-red Nebraska. The GOP hammered him with “Bernie Sanders of Nebraska”-style attack ads. They tried hard to brand him as a Democrat.Yet, on Election Day, he lost by just under 7 percentage points, scoring 46.5% of the vote to Republican incumbent Deb Fischer’s 53.2%, in a state Trump won by over 20 points. That means Osborn overperformed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris by a stunning 13 points.Osborn is a labor organizer and Navy vet. His platform? Lower taxes on small businesses, raise the minimum wage, legalize marijuana, expand union rights, preserve gun ownership. He backed tougher border enforcement but supported legal pathways for undocumented workers. He wanted to protect Social Security benefits and expand funding for public schools.As a progressive, I hate some of that. But I love other parts. And more importantly, most of it is opposed by Nebraska’s Republican incumbents. Osborn’s secret? A relentless focus on economic livelihoods while neutralizing Democrats’ social-issue vulnerabilities.So no, I’m not violating my values by being thrilled that Osborn is exploring a run in 2026. He won’t give me my progressive utopia—but he could help stop the Republican dystopia if he won and caucused with Democrats. That’s a trade I’ll take.Osborn’s model could work elsewhere, and the path to the majority isn’t through only moderates. If we get lucky, we may see former Sen. Sherrod Brown attempt a comeback in Ohio. And Beto O’Rourke—who very nearly won a Senate race in Texas in 2018—has been campaigning with progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and eyeing another run.Former congressman Beto O'Rourke speaks with the media in August 2019, outside of the Walmart store in the aftermath of a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.Progressives will have plenty of candidates to be excited about. But if we want a durable Senate majority—one that can one day bring in D.C. and Puerto Rico statehood—we must recenter the party around the economic issues that unify the working majority.Forget the MAGA base. They’re gone. No one is catering to those A-holes. But a huge swath of Americans simply want a government that improves their lives.If our brand becomes “we prioritize transgender athletes playing on teams that match their gender identity”—a position opposed by 65% of likely voters, per Echelon Insights’ poll—we won’t win. It sucks to write that, believe me, but losing elections hurts more, as Trump proves every single day.We can make common cause with voters on what unites us. Here are two other left-leaning causes that polled especially well, per Echelon Insights:Raise the minimum wage to $20/hour: 58% support, 37% oppose.Raises taxes on those making over $250,000: 68% support, 27% oppose.Heck, one item in the poll even asked whether voters thought it was “the responsibility of the federal government to ensure everyone has health care.” And guess what? Sixty-two percent of voters think it is the government’s responsibility, while only 34% think it isn’t.Conservatives keep saying Americans don’t want socialism, but is there anything more socialist than universal health coverage? And Americans support that by a nearly 2-1 margin! Guys, we can win big on those issues—and more! We can deliver the American Dream. And in doing so, we can build broader support for our fuller progressive agenda over time.That’s how we win. That’s how we govern. And that’s how we fight for everyone—including the most marginalized—without dooming ourselves to permanent minority status.Campaign Action",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/6/25/2329879/-The-Senate-majority-runs-through-moderate-America,politics,

2025-06-26 04:00:01,AI's reasoning problems — why ‘thinking' models may not actually be smarter,"AI reasoning models were supposed to be the industry’s next leap, promising smarter systems able to tackle more complex problems and a path to superintelligence.The latest releases from the major players in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet and DeepSeek, have been models with reasoning capabilities. Those reasoning models can execute on tougher tasks by “thinking,” or breaking problems into logical steps and showing their work. Now, a string of recent research is calling that into question.In June, a team of Apple researchers released a white paper titled “The Illusion of Thinking,” which found that “state-of-the-art [large reasoning models] still fail to develop generalizable problem-solving capabilities, with accuracy ultimately collapsing to zero beyond certain complexities across different environments.” In other words, once problems get complex enough, reasoning models stop working. Even more concerning, the models aren’t “generalizable,” meaning they might be just memorizing patterns instead of coming up with genuinely new solutions. “We can make it do really well on benchmarks. We can make it do really well on specific tasks,” said Ali Ghodsi, the CEO of AI data analytics platform Databricks. “Some of the papers you alluded to show it doesn’t generalize. So while it’s really good at this task, it’s awful at very common sense things that you and I would do in our sleep. And that’s, I think, a fundamental limitation of reasoning models right now.” Researchers at Salesforce, Anthropic and other AI labs have also raised red flags about reasoning models. Salesforce calls it “jagged intelligence” and finds that there’s “significant gap between current [large language models] capabilities and real-world enterprise demand.”The constraints could indicate cracks in a story that has sent AI infrastructure stocks like Nvidia booming. “The amount of computation we need at this point as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily a hundred times more than we thought we needed this time last year,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s GTC event in March. To be sure, some experts say Apple’s warnings about reasoning models may be the iPhone maker shifting the conversation because it is seen as playing catch up in the AI race. The company has had a series of setbacks with its highly-touted Apple Intelligence suite of AI services.Most notably, Apple had to delay key upgrades to its Siri voice assistant to sometime in 2026, and the company did not make many announcements regarding AI at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this month.“Apple’s putting out papers right now saying LLMs and reasoning don’t really work,” said Daniel Newman, Futurum Group CEO on CNBC’s “The Exchange.” Having Apple’s paper come out after WWDC “sounds more like ‘Oops, look over here, we don’t know exactly what we’re doing.'”Watch this video to learn more.",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/ais-reasoning-problems-why-thinking-models-may-not-actually-be-smarter/3856600/,business,
2025-06-26 04:00:00,"BIK Data Analysis indicates: Including BNPL Transaction Data in Credit History Could Help Almost Every Second ""Thin-file Customer"" Improve their Creditworthiness","WARSAW, Poland, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BNPL payments are no longer just a way of financing purchases, but also constitute an innovative factor supporting the development of the Polish credit market. An analysis carried out by the Polish credit bureau BIK found that BNPL users are good at repaying their debts. For 40 percent of ""thin-file bank customers"" who also use BNPL, combining the two data sources may improve their creditworthiness. The degree of such an improvement can have a significant impact on credit decisions. It is also worth noting that this analysis was made possible by the unique data gathered by BIK and by the reporting standards for BNPL transactions developed together with the financial sector.In the sections that follows, we present:the positive aspects of reporting BNPL data to the credit bureauhow using BNPL will either have no impact on or could raise the creditworthiness of as many as two thirds of borrowers who use this productthe significance of BNPL as a service supporting the development of the financial sector and accounting for 16 percent of new customer acquisitionhow BNPL data can facilitate broader access to the credit market for consumerswhether there is a risk of over-indebtedness for people using BNPLThe customer base actively using bank loans in Poland has been declining for approximately three years. As of now, 14.2 million individuals hold loans or credit in the banking sector, which is 7% fewer than at the end of 2019.One indisputable source of new customers entering the market is the ""Buy Now Pay Later"" (BNPL) product. This conclusion is based on BIK's analysis of the database of BNPL transactions systematically submitted and reported to it. The BIK credit bureau aggregates such data from the banking sector as well as lending institutions, whose full reporting to BIK came into effect in May 2023. Over 16 percent of new customers on Poland's financial market in 2025 used BNPL as their first financial product, and over 55 percent of them were customers aged up 24 years old.It is worth emphasising that there are two types of deferred payment (BNPL) products in use on the Polish market: instalment-based and revolving. Instalment BNPL refers to transactions that finance the purchase of specific goods over a short, interest-free period of up to 35 days (grace period), after which the debt is repaid. If the amount is then spread across a set number of instalments, additional costs may apply. The second type of transaction – revolving BNPL – allows purchases to be made within a renewable limit agreed upon with the bank.Although the BNPL service is still relatively new, it is experiencing rapid growth. The value of financing via ""Buy Now Pay Later"" options in Poland, provided mainly by non-bank institutions, reached a level of EUR 2.54 bn (PLN 10.8 bn) in 2024, while the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/06/g46107817/bik-data-analysis-indicates-including-bnpl-transaction-data-in-credit-history-could-help-almost-ev,business,

2025-06-26 03:29:57,"Oxford, Cambridge fall in global college rankings — experts say it's a red flag for UK innovation","Top British universities fell in global rankings last week, with experts raising red flags about the region’s ability to continue attracting international talent and nurturing innovation.The annual QS World University Rankings saw Britain’s elite Oxford and Cambridge universities drop one place to fourth and sixth, respectively. Meanwhile, 54 of 90 British universities fell in rankings. They include a number of leading ones, including the University of Edinburgh, which dropped seven places to 34th, and the London School of Economics and Political Science, which dropped six places to 56th.QS World University Rankings measured the performance of over 1,500 universities in more than 100 locations globally using metrics such as research and discovery, learning experience, employability, global engagement, and sustainability.However, Sankar Sivarajah, head of Kingston Business School, told CNBC Make It that despite the headline figures, there has been some progress: 17 of the 90 U.K. universities made the global top 100 and institutions such as Imperial College London, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and University College London held their positions in the top 10.‘Intensifying global competition’Nevertheless, “the sector faces significant challenges from intensifying global competition, declining research funding, and difficulties in improving metrics such as faculty-student ratio and internationalization,” Sivarajah said.He explained that institutions in China, Singapore, and Australia are “making sustained investments in research, international partnerships, and faculty recruitment,” while the U.K. lags behind in those areas.“The UK must prioritize sustained investment in research and development, focus on graduate outcomes and employer reputation, and strengthen strategic global engagement to remain competitive,” he said.Edward Knight, president at venture capital firm Antler, added that the declining ranking, on top of a proposed 6% tax on foreign students studying at U.K. universities, could make the region a less attractive study destination.“What I hear at the same time ... is that increasingly, in places like China and India, the narrative is shifting to ‘Hey, kids don’t go abroad to study anymore. You can stay at home.’ So the combination of that plus taxes to make it more expensive, for foreign students, is obviously not helpful,” Knight said.“If you’re putting taxes on people coming in around at the same time as there’s a growing hesitance to actually go and study abroad anyway, then that’s obviously not a particularly healthy set of drivers for the overall health of the ecosystem,” Knight added.‘Europe is significantly behind the rest of the world’British universities falling behind in global rankings is also a wake-up call for the region’s tech and startup sector, which has persistently been seen as lagging behind the U.S. and China.“It’s all well and good saying the U.K. is the leading place for innovation in Europe, but I think that you’re going to get a more rounded, more balanced perspective if the reference set is actually broader than that,” Knight said.He pointed out that artificial intelligence will be integrated into the national curriculum in China from primary school; the U.S. has the Stargate Project, an initiative investing $500 billion over the next four years to build AI infrastructure; and the Abu Dhabi launched MGX, an investment firm for AI technologies.“I think what you would probably conclude is that it’s all fine being on top of the pile in Europe, but Europe is significantly behind the rest of the world,” Knight added.Knight noted that Cambridge University has produced some of the region’s finest tech companies, including DeepMind and Darktrace, but that the U.K. has lost those firms to the United States. Darktrace was bought by a private equity firm in the U.S., while DeepMind was sold to Google.“For some reason, these companies feel that they are better domiciled in the United States, but also because the growth multiple, the growth valuation the market in the U.S. puts in these companies is higher than it is in the UK,” Knight said.“Revolut is probably a $50 billion company.

2025-06-26 03:25:00,At Least 5 Reasons Why Trump Should Reject A Nobel Peace Prize,"At Least 5 Reasons Why Trump Should Reject A Nobel Peace Prize Submitted by Issues & Insights Editorial Board,For a brief window this week, President Donald Trump was out of the running for a Nobel Peace Prize, after a Ukrainian lawmaker withdrew his nomination on Monday for not ending the war there, and before Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., nominated him on Tuesday for the ceasefire between Israel and Iran.You can imagine the guffaws and hair-pulling from the Trump-is-Hitler crowd at the thought that anyone would see him as a suitable candidate for this prize.But as much as we’d love to watch their heads explode as he walked up to accept the award, we think Trump should take himself out of the running.Sure, he probably did more for world peace when he bombed Iran’s nuclear sites than any president since Ronald Reagan did when he left Michael Gorbachev high and dry at Reykjavík and sparked the end of the Soviet Union.But why in the world would Trump want to join the ranks of other Nobel Peace Prize winners?This is an award that was given to Yasser Arafat, a man once described as the “Father of Modern Terrorism” and who, two years after taking home the prize money, declared that:“We plan to eliminate the State of Israel and establish a purely Palestinian state. We will make life unbearable for Jews by psychological warfare and population explosion ... We Palestinians will take over everything.”It was given to Jimmy Carter, now the second-worst president in U.S. history after Joe Biden, whose weakness led to the Iranian revolution, a year-long hostage crisis, and Soviet Union advances around the world.And does Trump really want to share an honor bestowed on Al Gore, whose only real claim to fame is getting fabulously rich by spreading lies and misinformation about “global warming”?He’d also be joining the likes of Rigoberta Menchú, whose autobiography was later attacked as fraudulent and who the Center for the Study of Popular Culture described as a “Marxist terrorist now exposed as an intellectual hoax.”But more embarrassing than all of these (as well as other dubious winners such as Le Duc Tho, Henry Kissinger, the European Union, Mikhail Gorbachev – not Reagan – etc.) is that Trump would be accepting a prize that was given to Barack Obama nine months into his presidency on the basis of .... absolutely nothing.Like Carter before him and Biden after him, Obama showed the dangers to peace from weakness. On his watch, Russia invaded Crimea, ISIS ran wild, and Iran used his sweetheart deal to advance its nuclear ambitions. And it was this “champion of peace” who would go on to authorize more than 560 missile attacks in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, one of which killed a U.S. citizen, for which he apologized. Others hit a wedding party and a funeral.Human Rights Watch concluded that two Obama-authorized attacks “were in clear violation of international humanitarian law – the laws of war – because they struck only civilians or used indiscriminate weapons.” Four others “may have violated the laws of war because the individual attacked was not a lawful military target or the attack caused disproportionate civilian harm.”Nobel-Peace-Prize-winning Obama would later be accused by Cornell West and others of being a war criminal.Why would anyone want to be associated with this crowd?If Trump were to turn down the award and call the Nobel Prize committee out for its wretched history of lionizing leftist terrorists, liars, and imbeciles, he’d do even more to advance world peace than any of its recipients.

Andrew Cuomo in the New York City Democratic primary for mayor shocked Wall Street, and pretty much everyone else including those Gen Zers who voted for him, who were then shocked to learn what socialism means after googling the term. People in New York started Googling what Socialism was after the polls closedLol. Lmao even. pic.twitter.com/xqyerSgUhD— Inverse Cramer (@CramerTracker) June 25, 2025And with Polymarket putting the socialist's odds of winning the final vote at 73%, Wall Street's panic is completely justified.As the WSJ reports, some of the world’s most influential and powerful financiers were left grasping to understand what Mamdani’s victory would mean for their industry, and whether when they would leave the city.“It’s officially hot commie summer,” Dan Loeb, chief executive of hedge fund Third Point, and a major Cuomo backer, wrote on X.It’s officially hot commie summer.— Daniel S. Loeb (@DanielSLoeb1) June 25, 2025Mamdani’s campaign was, up until a few weeks ago, a long shot. On Polymarket, which successfully predicted the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, Cuomo had odds as high as 92.5% on May 27. Negative ads against Mamdani paid for by Wall Street-funded super political-action committees, as well as also-ran candidate Whitney Tilson, himself a failed investor and now selling get rich quick scams on CNBC and anyone else who will accept his ads, blanketed airwaves and filled residents’ mailboxes. Mamdani’s platform includes sharply increasing taxes on those making more than $1 million a year, making the city ""more affordable"" by freezing rents on rent-stabilized apartments, investing $70 billion in publicly subsidized housing (that's $70 billion in other people's money of course), providing free bus service and opening government-operated grocery stores (similar to the government operated grocery stores in 1985 USSR).In his inimitable style, Matt Taibbi described Mamdani's ascent as follows: New York City’s mayoral race has been won by Zohran Mamdani, no Bernie Sanders-style imitator but the real thing — son of a famed socialist scholar and Marvel superhero to every Jacobin-reading, keffiyeh-wearing student activist huddled in Judean People’s Front-type confabs, between bell hooks readings and visits to Mom and Dad on the Upper West Side. In this country, it’s the most significant movement victory in a century, almost certainly presaging in the near future an epic clash at the summit of American politics between socialism and, well, anything else. As Michael Buffer would say, “Let’s get ready to rum-m-m-bleMeanwhile, Cuomo’s lock on Wall Street was all but taken for granted. He had the loud backing from billionaire figures such as Bill Ackman, Loeb and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.In the end, it wasn't enough and on Tuesday night, Mamdani’s win became apparent immediately after polls closed: A nine-point lead in early votes held about steady as the day-of voting results came in. Cuomo conceded before the end of the night, leaving open questions of whether he will run in the general election in November.But while trust fund socialists like this lot were delighted at the outcome - and why not, when NYC turns into a communist shithole they can just flee to their daddy's mansion in Florida...Young socialists go wild while celebrating Zohran Mamdani winning the NYC Mayoral Democratic Primary.pic.twitter.com/xD7eaE6U5b— Oli London (@OliLondonTV) June 25, 2025... Wall Street quickly started to worry: “There are a lot of warning signs flashing here. The next mayor here is going to have his hands full,” said Ed Skyler, a former deputy mayor under Bloomberg, who is now an executive at Citigroup.Some financial executives spoke to the WSJ of backing Mayor Eric Adams, who is expected to run in November election under party lines he created: “Safe&Affordable” and “EndAntiSemitism.” Financial titans had found Adams an early improvement from his predecessor Bill de Blasio.Corporate leaders held a flurry of private phone calls to plot how to fight back against Mamdani’s primary victory and discussed backing an outside group with the goal of raising around $20 million to oppose him, according to people familiar with the matter. The calls also discussed efforts to coalesce behind Adams and working to keep Cuomo out of the race, the people said. They also discussed trying to get Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, to drop out by getting the White House to offer him a job in the Trump administration, the people said. Not everyone was downbeat about the primary results, though. On CNBC, Philippe Laffont, founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, said the city would likely continue to thrive, arguing that it withstood the tenure of disgraced corrupt socialist de Blasio, who embraced Marxist policies that many in the business community opposed.“We had Mayor de Blasio for eight years, New York is really strong, I’m hopeful the same will happen,” he said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “And there’s still an election.”Still, Mamdani’s wide support exposed how Wall Street has changed in recent decades. There were more individual donors from major banks to Mamdani than there were to Cuomo, according to city campaign-finance records where donors listed their employers. But many of them were among the increasingly large ranks of tech staff and other non-finance employees (read: foreigners). The WSJ found that three Goldman Sachs software engineers were listed as donating directly to Mamdani, for instance (most of them probably from India). Only one financier at Goldman publicly gave directly to Cuomo, according to the records. Other bankers who quietly supported Mamdani wouldn’t talk to the Journal on the record. One tried to use a fake name. The level of support for Cuomo among the moneyed set was so high that viral TikTok videos skewered the phenomenon in recent weeks, as Election Day neared. “You seem like such an alpha,” a woman says in one video to her fictional date with a finance bro. “So, you’re voting for Cuomo, right?”Dating in NYC summed up wtf 😒 pic.twitter.com/v3R9937zTk— Murray Hill Guy (@MurrayHillGuy1) June 25, 2025But even with high support, Cuomo’s campaign lacked the kind of enthusiasm that rocketed Mamdani to his primary win, even among bankers and traders. “Confidence is a great trait, but it didn’t get his supporters out to vote,” Skyler said.Wednesday, bankers and traders were trying to figure out the repercussions of a Mamdani mayoralty, should he win the general election. Some voiced concern about Mamdani’s plan to freeze the rent of millions of New Yorkers who live in rent stabilized apartments, saying it would deter new investment in housing, reduce supply and push up prices for everyone else. “I can’t believe I even need to say this, but socialism doesn’t work,” said Anthony Pompliano, CEO of Professional Capital Management, a bitcoin-focused financial services company. “It has failed in every American city it was tried.”Then, there were renewed questions about whether the recent exodus from Wall Street to other states such as Florida and Texas would accelerate under Mamdani. Some executives cited concerns about taxes and crime under a potential Mamdani administration. Sander Gerber, chief executive of investment firm Hudson Bay Capital, said he fielded texts from some of his 170 employees who said they were “thinking of leaving.”In a midday note from Goldman's trading desk, the bank noted that its NYC Office REITs basket tumbled 430bps amid the ""big focus on the back of Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani winning last night. Lot of inbounds on what this potential administration means for NYC exposed REITs, particularly across Office and Apartment REITs with exposure to NYC.""Some developers and landlords said they are already making plans to exit New York and focus on more business-friendly markets like Miami, Dallas or Nashville.“I’m depressed and sad,” said Ricky Sandler, who runs Eminence Capital, a Midtown Manhattan hedge fund, which employs 55 people. “If Mamdani becomes mayor, I will likely move my business and family out of New York.”Last but not least, this tweet from Tyler Winklevoss lays it out best: it's time to let New York burn.A lot of people have asked me if I will get involved in the NYC mayor race by supporting a candidate that can defeat Zohran Mamdani. TBH, I’m torn and undecided. Like every other city run by democrats, NYC is a broken kleptocracy. Taxes are astronomical and services are pathetic...— Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) June 26, 2025 Tyler DurdenWed, 06/25/2025 - 23:00",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/wall-street-panics-socialist-set-take-over-new-york-reits-tumble-idiocy-it-all,business,

Revenues at the world’s second-largest clothing retailer dipped year-on-year to 56.71 billion Swedish krona. The company did not provide specific detail on the impact of trade tariffs, but said it was closely watching the situation.Swedish clothing giant H&M on Thursday reported weaker-than-expected sales in the fiscal second quarter but pointed to an uptick in demand to kick-start the summer season.Revenues at the world’s second-largest clothing retailer dipped year-on-year to 56.71 billion Swedish krona ($5.99 billion) in the three-month period to May. 31, slightly below the 57.01 billion Swedish krona forecast by LSEG analysts. In local currencies, sales were up 1%.Operating profit totaled 5.9 billion Swedish krona over the quarter, in line with expectations.Shares were up 5.2% by 8:07 a.m. London time.CEO Daniel Erver said that the quarter’s results were “negatively affected” by higher purchasing prices from a more expensive U.S. dollar and higher freight costs.The company noted, however, that sales in June were expected to increase 3% in local currencies as demand shows signs of picking up over the summer months.“The negative external factors that increased the costs of purchasing for the first half of the year are turning positive for the second half of the year,” Erver said in a statement accompanying the results.H&M, which counts the U.S. as its second-largest single market and heavily depends on production in Asia — notably China and Bangladesh — did not provide specific detail on the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, but said it was watching the situation.It nevertheless noted cautiousness among consumers in current “uncertain times.”“The company is closely monitoring developments in global trade and trade restrictions. With good flexibility in the supply chain and through the pricing of the customer offering there are opportunities to adapt the business to changed conditions,” Erver added.It also flagged 200 store closures scheduled for 2025, primarily in established markets, and 80 new store openings, largely in growth markets.The fashion retailer previously reported a slow start to the year, but pointed to an annual uptick in sales in March.H&M has faced several consecutive quarters of soft sales, as it has struggled to close a widening gap with Inditex-owned rival Zara and fend off increased competition from lower-cost retailers, such as Shein and Temu.U.S. tariffs and weak consumer confidence have nevertheless become a drag for the retail sector more widely, with Inditex earlier this month posting weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and a slower start to the summer amid broad economic uncertainty.Retail and consumer goods emerged as the most distressed sector in Europe, according to a new report from law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, which cited tight credit conditions, cost inflation and weaker consumer demand among pressures on the industry.This is a developing story and will be updated shortly.",nbcphiladelphia,https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/blacklisted-by-the-u-s-and-backed-by-beijing-this-chinese-ai-startup-has-caught-openais-attention/4219593/,business,

2025-06-26 02:35:00,ISIS-Inspired Drone War Plans Leaked From US National Security Council,"ISIS-Inspired Drone War Plans Leaked From US National Security Council Authored by José Niño via Headline USA,According to leaked documents, British and American academics advised the U.S. National Security Council to encourage Ukraine to adopt ISIS-style drone tactics against Russian railways.In a report published by investigative journalist Kit Klarenberg for The Grayzone on Monday, Project Alchemy, a secret academic-intelligence cell whose mission was “to keep Ukraine fighting” by imposing “strategic dilemmas, costs and frictions upon Russia” was revealed as the network allegedly behind these plans.The academic recommendations were delivered to Colonel Tim Wright, who served as the Biden administration’s Director for Russia at the National Security Council from August 2021 to July 2022. The proposals came from three key drone experts within a broader Ukraine Working Group composed of “approximately 60 experts hailing from states throughout NATO” who sought to “assist Ukraine’s defense (short of deploying combat forces).”Zachary Kallenborn from George Mason University’s Schar School advocated for “two-stage attacks like ISIS did frequently” on Russian railways, recommending Ukraine “break the track, and wait for the engineers to come to fix it, then use the drone to kill them.” An unnamed Durham University researcher identified as “M.E.D.” cited Islamic State’s “innovative” use of drones as documented in a July 2018 West Point paper, suggesting commercial drones could be “modified via a simple drop mechanism... to serve as effective munitions delivery platforms.”Dominika Kunertova, formerly of ETH Zurich’s Center for Security Studies and currently directing drone warfare research at the Atlantic Council, recommended targeting “anything that uses” railroads as opposed to the infrastructure itself.These academic blueprints proved prophetic when Ukraine launched Operation Spider Web late last month conducting bold drone attacks inside Russia that killed seven people and injured more than 30, including two children.The timing proved particularly significant as these attacks took place “on the eve of scheduled negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.”Ukrainian forces subsequently destroyed a Russian fuel train late last month using a DJI Mavic III drone, one of the specific models Kallenborn had recommended for modification.The attacks continued through this month with Operation Spiderweb 2.0, demonstrating how the “British-born strategy has heavily influenced the thinking of Kiev’s increasingly desperate military.” Tyler DurdenWed, 06/25/2025 - 22:35",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/isis-inspired-drone-war-plans-leaked-us-national-security-council,business,

Here's why","The Trump Organization has removed a reference to the recently-announced T1 smartphone being made in America. The T1’s webpage now has a reference to “American-Proud Design.” The website says the device is “brought to life right here in the USA.” When the T1 was initially announced, experts told CNBC the device would likely be made in China.The Trump Organization scrapped a reference that its recently revealed smartphone will be made in the U.S., amid doubts that such a device can be manufactured on American shores at its price tag.A spokesperson for the Trump Organization, which is owned by U.S. President Donald Trump, nevertheless maintained the handset would be made in the U.S.This month, the Trump Organization introduced the T1, a gold-colored device set to retail for $499. At the time of the announcement, a banner on the homepage of the company’s website said: “Our MADE IN THE USA ‘T1 Phone’ is available for pre-order now.”The reference to where the phone will be produced has been completely removed. The change was first noted by The Verge.The T1’s webpage now says the phone has “American-Proud Design” and is “brought to life right here in the USA” — though it’s unclear if that means it will actually be manufactured in America.When the T1 was initially announced, experts told CNBC the device would likely be made in China by a local third-party company. The U.S. does not have an advanced supply chain to manufacture smartphones. Even if it did, many components would still need to come from overseas.However, in a statement to USA TODAY, Trump Mobile Spokesperson Chris Walker, said that “T1 phones are proudly being made in America.”“Speculation to the contrary is simply inaccurate,” Walker said.The language about manufacturing location is not the only thing that has changed on the T1 website. Some of the features and specs of the device have also been updated.In the initial announcement, the Trump Mobile website said the T1 would have a 6.8-inch AMOLED screen. That has now been reduced to 6.25-inch AMOLED display.

2025-06-26 02:30:01,CNBC Daily Open: Funny how the S&P 500 is teasing a new high amid uncertainties,"H&M has faced several consecutive quarters of soft sales, as it has struggled to close a widening gap with rivals Inditex, Shein and Temu. Revenues at the world’s second-largest clothing retailer dipped year-on-year to 56.71 billion Swedish krona. The company did not provide specific detail on the impact of trade tariffs, but said it was closely watching the situation.Swedish clothing giant H&M on Thursday reported weaker-than-expected sales in the fiscal second quarter but pointed to an uptick in demand to kick-start the summer season.Revenues at the world’s second-largest clothing retailer dipped year-on-year to 56.71 billion Swedish krona ($5.99 billion) in the three-month period to May. 31, slightly below the 57.01 billion Swedish krona forecast by LSEG analysts. In local currencies, sales were up 1%.Operating profit totaled 5.9 billion Swedish krona over the quarter, in line with expectations.Shares were up 5.2% by 8:07 a.m. London time.CEO Daniel Erver said that the quarter’s results were “negatively affected” by higher purchasing prices from a more expensive U.S. dollar and higher freight costs.The company noted, however, that sales in June were expected to increase 3% in local currencies as demand shows signs of picking up over the summer months.“The negative external factors that increased the costs of purchasing for the first half of the year are turning positive for the second half of the year,” Erver said in a statement accompanying the results.H&M, which counts the U.S. as its second-largest single market and heavily depends on production in Asia — notably China and Bangladesh — did not provide specific detail on the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, but said it was watching the situation.It nevertheless noted cautiousness among consumers in current “uncertain times.”“The company is closely monitoring developments in global trade and trade restrictions. With good flexibility in the supply chain and through the pricing of the customer offering there are opportunities to adapt the business to changed conditions,” Erver added.It also flagged 200 store closures scheduled for 2025, primarily in established markets, and 80 new store openings, largely in growth markets.The fashion retailer previously reported a slow start to the year, but pointed to an annual uptick in sales in March.H&M has faced several consecutive quarters of soft sales, as it has struggled to close a widening gap with Inditex-owned rival Zara and fend off increased competition from lower-cost retailers, such as Shein and Temu.U.S. tariffs and weak consumer confidence have nevertheless become a drag for the retail sector more widely, with Inditex earlier this month posting weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and a slower start to the summer amid broad economic uncertainty.Retail and consumer goods emerged as the most distressed sector in Europe, according to a new report from law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, which cited tight credit conditions, cost inflation and weaker consumer demand among pressures on the industry.This is a developing story and will be updated shortly.",nbcphiladelphia,https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/daily-open-funny-how-the-sp-500-is-teasing-a-new-high-amid-uncertainties/4219584/,business,

2025-06-26 02:10:00,'Why Not An Islamic Bomb?': How Israel Planned & Failed To Stop Pakistan Going Nuclear,"'Why Not An Islamic Bomb?': How Israel Planned & Failed To Stop Pakistan Going Nuclear Via Middle East EyeFormer CIA Director George Tenet thought him ""at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden"" and former Mossad Chief Shabtai Shavit regretted not killing him. But to almost 250 million Pakistanis, Abdul Qadeer Khan - the godfather of Pakistan’s nuclear programme - is a legend and national hero.The nuclear scientist, who was born in 1936 and died in 2021 aged 85, was more responsible than anyone else for the South Asian nation developing a nuclear bomb. He ran a sophisticated and clandestine international network assisting Iran, Libya and North Korea with their nuclear programs. One of those nations, North Korea, ended up getting the coveted military status symbol. Israel - itself a nuclear power, although it has never admitted it - allegedly used assassination attempts and threats to try and stop Pakistan from going nuclear.Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan in January 2010, AFPIn the 1980s Israel even formulated a plan to bomb Pakistan’s nuclear site with Indian assistance - a scheme that the Indian government eventually backed out of.AQ Khan, as he is commonly remembered by Pakistanis, believed that by building a nuclear bomb he had saved his country from foreign threats, especially its nuclear-armed neighbor India.Today many of his fellow citizens agree.‘Why not an Islamic bomb?’Pakistan first decided to build a bomb after its larger neighbor had done so. On 18 May 1974 India tested its first nuclear weapon, which it codenamed Smiling Buddha. Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto immediately vowed to develop nuclear weapons for his own country. ""We will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own,"" he said. There was, he declared, ""a Christian bomb, a Jewish bomb and now a Hindu bomb. Why not an Islamic bomb?""Born during British rule of the Indian subcontinent, AQ Khan completed a science degree at Karachi University in 1960 before studying metallurgical engineering in Berlin. He also went on to study in the Netherlands and Belgium. By 1974 Khan was working for a subcontractor of a major nuclear fuel company, Urenco, in Amsterdam.The company supplied enriched uranium nuclear fuel for European nuclear reactors. Khan had access to top secret areas of the Urenco facility and blueprints of the world’s best centrifuges, which enriched natural uranium and turned it into bomb fuel.In January 1976 he made a sudden and mysterious departure from the Netherlands, saying he had been made “an offer I can’t refuse in Pakistan”. Khan was later accused of having stolen a blueprint for uranium centrifuges, which can turn uranium into weapons-grade fuel, from the Netherlands.That July he set up a research laboratory in Rawalpindi which produced enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. For a few years the operation proceeded in secret. Dummy companies imported the components Khan needed to build an enrichment program, the official story being that they were going towards a new textile mill.While there is significant evidence indicating that Pakistan’s military establishment was supporting Khan’s work, civilian governments were generally kept in the dark, with the exception of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (who had proposed the initiative). Even the late prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s daughter, was not told a word about the programe by her generals. She only found out about it in 1989 by accident - in Tehran. Iranian President Rafsanjani asked her whether they could reaffirm the two countries’ agreement on “special defense matters”.“What exactly are you talking about, Mr President?” asked Bhutto, confused. “Nuclear technology, Madam Prime Minister, nuclear technology,” replied the Iranian president. Bhutto was stunned. Assassination attempts and threatsIn June 1979, the operation was exposed by the magazine 8 Days. There was an international uproar. Israel protested to the Dutch, who ordered an inquiry. A Dutch court convicted Khan in 1983 for attempted espionage (the conviction was later overturned on a technicality). But work on the nuclear program continued.By 1986, Khan was confident Pakistan had the capability to produce nuclear weapons.His motivation was in large part ideological: “I want to question the holier-than-thou attitude of the Americans and British,” he said. “Are these bastards God-appointed guardians of the world?”There were serious efforts to sabotage the program, including a series of assassination attempts widely understood to have been the work of Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad.Executives at European companies doing business with Khan found themselves targeted. A letter bomb was sent to one in West Germany - he escaped but his dog was killed. Another bombing targeted a senior executive of Swiss company Cora Engineering, which worked on Pakistan’s nuclear program.Historians, including Adrian Levy, Catherine Scott-Clark and Adrian Hanni, have argued that the Mossad used threats and assassination attempts in a failed campaign to prevent Pakistan from building the bomb. Siegfried Schertler, the owner of one company, told Swiss Federal Police that Mossad agents phoned him and his salesmen repeatedly.He said he was approached by an employee of the Israeli embassy in Germany, a man named David, who told him to stop “these businesses” regarding nuclear weapons. The Israelis “didn’t want a Muslim country to have the bomb”, according to Feroz Khan, a former official in Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program.Imran Khan (L) walks with AQ Khan after a meeting at his residence in Islamabad on 7 February 2009 (AFP)In the early 1980s Israel proposed to India that the two collaborate to bomb and destroy Pakistan’s nuclear facility at Kahuta in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district.Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi approved the strike. A plan developed for Israeli F-16s and F-15s to take off from the Jamnagar airbase in India’s Gujarat and launch strikes on the facility. But Gandhi later backed out and the plan was shelved.In 1987, when her son Rajiv Gandhi was prime minister, the Indian army chief Lieutenant General Krishnaswami Sundarji tried to start a war with Pakistan so India could bomb the nuclear facility at Kahuta.He sent half a million troops to the Pakistani border for military drills, along with hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles - an extraordinary provocation. But this attempt at triggering hostilities failed after the Indian prime minister, who had not been properly briefed on Sundarji’s plan, instigated a deescalation with Pakistan.Despite Indian and Israeli opposition, both the US and China covertly helped Pakistan. China provided the Pakistanis with enriched uranium, tritium and even scientists. Meanwhile, American support came because Pakistan was an important Cold War ally. US President Jimmy Carter cut aid to Pakistan in April 1979 in response to Pakistan’s program being exposed, but then reversed the decision months later when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan: America would need the help of neighboring Pakistan.In the 1980s, the US covertly gave Pakistani nuclear scientists technical training and turned a blind eye to its program. But everything changed with the end of the Cold War.In October 1990 the US halted economic and military aid to Pakistan in protest against the nuclear program. Pakistan then said it would stop developing nuclear weapons. AQ Khan later revealed, though, that the production of highly enriched uranium secretly continued.The seventh nuclear powerOn 11 May 1998 India tested its nuclear warheads. Pakistan then successfully tested its own in the Balochistan desert later that month. The US responded by sanctioning both India and Pakistan.Pakistan had become the world’s seventh nuclear power.And Khan was a national hero. He was driven around in motorcades as large as the prime minister’s and was guarded by army commandos. Streets, schools and multiple cricket teams were named after him. He wasn’t known for playing down his achievements.“Who made the atom bomb? I made it,” Khan declared on national television. “Who made the missiles? I made them for you.” But Khan had also organized another, particularly daring, operation.From the mid-1980s onwards, he ran an international nuclear network which sent technology and designs to Iran, North Korea and Libya.He would order double the number of parts the Pakistani nuclear program required and then secretly sell the excess on.In the 1980s the Iranian government - despite Ayatollah Khomeini’s opposition to the bomb on the grounds that it was Islamically prohibited - approached Pakistan’s military dictator, General Zia-ul-Haq, for help. Between 1986 and 2001, Pakistan gave Iran key components needed to make a bomb, although these tended to be secondhand - Khan kept the most advanced technology for Pakistan. The Mossad had Khan under surveillance as he travelled around the Middle East in the 1980s and 1990s, but failed to work out what the scientist was doing.Then-Mossad chief Shavit later said that if he had realised Khan’s intentions, he would have considered ordering Khan to be assassinated to “change the course of history”.Gaddafi exposes the operationIn the end, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi blew Khan’s operation in 2003 while attempting to win support from the US. Gaddafi disclosed to the CIA and MI6 that Khan was building nuclear sites for his government - some of which were disguised as chicken farms. The CIA siezed machinery bound for Libya as it was being smuggled through the Suez Canal. Investigators found weapons blueprints in bags from an Islamabad dry cleaner.When the operation was exposed, the Americans were horrified. “It was an astounding transformation when you think about it, something we've never seen before,"" a senior American official told the New York Times. ""First, [Khan] exploits a fragmented market and develops a quite advanced nuclear arsenal. “Then he throws the switch, reverses the flow and figures out how to sell the whole kit, right down to the bomb designs, to some of the world's worst governments.""In 2004 Khan confessed to running the nuclear proliferation network, saying he had provided Iran, Libya and North Korea with nuclear technology.In February, he appeared on television and insisted he had acted alone, with no support from the Pakistani government, which then swiftly pardoned him. President Musharraf called him “my hero”. However, reportedly under US pressure, he placed Khan under effective house arrest in Islamabad until 2009. Later AQ Khan said that he “saved the country for the first time when I made Pakistan a nuclear nation and saved it again when I confessed and took the whole blame on myself”.He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006 but recovered after surgery. Enormously wealthy, in his later years, Khan funded a community centre in Islamabad and spent his time feeding monkeys. Those who knew him said Khan firmly believed what he had done was right.He wanted to stand up to the west and give nuclear technology to non-western, particularly Muslim, nations. “He also said that giving technology to a Muslim country was not a crime,” one anonymous acquaintance recalled.When Khan died of Covid in 2021, he was hailed as a “national icon” by then-Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. And that is how he is still widely remembered today in Pakistan.“[The] nation should be rest assured Pakistan is a safe atomic power,” the nuclear scientist had declared in 2019. “No one can cast an evil eye on it.” Tyler DurdenWed, 06/25/2025 - 22:10",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/why-not-islamic-bomb-how-israel-planned-failed-stop-pakistan-going-nuclear,business,

2025-06-26 02:02:18,How ‘Daddy' talk and Trump and Rutte's bromance stole the NATO spotlight,"H&M said it was considering price rises to offset the impact of tariffs and “remain competitive.” The world’s second-largest clothing retailer posted weaker-than-expected sales in the fiscal second quarter but pointed to an uptick in summer demand. The retail giant has faced several consecutive quarters of soft sales, as it has struggled to close a widening gap with rivals Inditex, Shein and Temu.Swedish clothing giant H&M on Thursday pointed to an uptick in demand to kick-start the summer season, sending shares higher.The world’s second-largest clothing retailer said sales in June were seen increasing 3% in local currencies following a slow start to the year.Shares were up 5.4% by 10:15 a.m. London time, slightly paring earlier gains.The company, whose brands also include Cos, Arket and Weekday, nevertheless noted a sense of caution among consumers in current “uncertain times,” noting that shoppers were “particularly price sensitive.”It did not provide specific detail on the impact of U.S. trade tariffs, but said that it was “closely monitoring developments” and considering price hikes to offset added costs.“We are starting to see some competitors increasing prices and this is something we are of course looking into to ensure we remain competitive,” CEO Daniel Erver said during an earnings call.H&M counts the U.S. as its second-largest single market and is heavily depends on production in Asia, most notably China and Bangladesh.“The U.S. is an important market for us and will continue to be,” Erver said, noting that the impact of tariffs would become clearer in July, once the 90-day levy pause expires.“With good flexibility in the supply chain and through the pricing of the customer offering there are opportunities to adapt the business to changed conditions,” the company added in a statement accompanying the results.It comes as H&M posted weaker-than-expected sales in the fiscal second quarter.Revenues at the retailer dipped year-on-year to 56.71 billion Swedish krona ($5.99 billion) in the three-month period to May. 31, slightly below the 57.01 billion Swedish krona forecast by LSEG analysts. In local currencies, sales were up 1%.Operating profit totaled 5.9 billion Swedish krona over the quarter, in line with expectations but down year-on-year.The company said that the quarter’s results were “negatively affected” by higher purchasing prices from a more expensive U.S. dollar and higher freight costs.“The negative external factors that increased the costs of purchasing for the first half of the year are turning positive for the second half of the year,” Erver said in a statement.It also flagged 200 store closures scheduled for 2025, primarily in established markets, and 80 new store openings, largely in growth markets.The fashion retailer previously reported a slow start to the year, but pointed to an annual uptick in sales in March.H&M has faced several consecutive quarters of soft sales, as it has struggled to close a widening gap with Inditex-owned rival Zara and fend off increased competition from lower-cost retailers, such as Shein and Temu.U.S. tariffs and weak consumer confidence have nevertheless become a drag for the retail sector more widely, with Inditex earlier this month posting weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and a slower start to the summer amid broad economic uncertainty.Retail and consumer goods emerged as the most distressed sector in Europe, according to a new report from law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, which cited tight credit conditions, cost inflation and weaker consumer demand among pressures on the industry.",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/how-daddy-talk-and-trump-and-ruttes-bromance-stole-the-nato-spotlight/3856575/,business,

2025-06-26 01:45:00,New COVID-Wave Scare-Campaign: A Massive Flop...,"New COVID-Wave Scare-Campaign: A Massive Flop... Authored by Rebekah Barnett via The Brownstone Institute,Like the Marvel franchise, with its unlimited instalments and spin-offs, a new Covid scare campaign is underway in Australia.Like the Marvel franchise, the entertainment content exists largely to create demand for merchandise. Unlike most Marvel films, this latest virus fear-mongering drive is turning out to be a massive flop.The hook: There’s a new “highly contagious” Covid Omicron subvariant in town, catchily named NB.1.8.1. Sticking with time-tested tradition, health authorities, experts, and media are playing the ‘cases, cases, cases’ angle, as the latest variant “sweeps the nation” with what I calculate to be Australia’s twelfth Covid wave since the pandemic scare series kicked off in 2020.Exposition: “According to Griffith University, the NB.1.8.1 variant makes up more than 40 per cent of total COVID cases tested in Victoria, around 25 per cent in Western Australia and New South Wales, around 20 per cent in Queensland and less than 10 per cent in South Australia,” reports ABC. “There are hundreds of different strains of Omicron, and the new subvariant NB.1.8.1 is driving up infections and hospitalisations, particularly in Asia and Western Australia,” reports the Daily Mail.Narrator’s aside: Case counts and hospitalisations are well within the normal range in Western Australia (WA), and no one has been admitted to ICU with Covid for months, according to the latest WA Health reporting.Source: Virus WAtch, 11 May 2025, WA Health.Source: Virus WAtch, 11 May 2025, WA Health.We’re not seeing anything out of the ordinary in national statistics either.Source: Australian Respiratory Surveillance Report – 5 May to 18 May 2025.Source: Australian Respiratory Surveillance Report – 5 May to 18 May 2025.However, we mustn’t let this contextualising information get in the way of the narrative arc.Climactic buildup: Back to cases, cases, cases. It’s “pretty much everywhere,” according to ABC. “Doctors are expecting a further spike in cases,” so “experts are urging people to get their COVID booster jab.”Source: ABCEndless vaccination is the only way out! Climactic escalation: But experts are furious that Australians are not vaccinating enough. You naughty, naughty Australians. In the past six months, only 6.6% of adults have received a Covid vaccine, according to recent federal figures, despite the vaccines being “free,” i.e., already paid for with your taxes.Source: Daily MailCrisis response: Our protagonist takes action to meet the threat head-on. After all, the government has product to shift, so the vaccine advertorial must keep pumping.Health Minister Mark Butler bravely does the media rounds, imploring anyone who can get a booster to “have a serious think” about following through.Source: news.com.auHero falters: Unfortunately for Butler, boosters aren’t recommended for many cohorts in Australia anymore, because the risk-benefit profile is not favourable for most people.Current Australian guidelines suggest adults aged over 75 should get a booster every six months, while those aged between 65 and 74, along with severely immunocompromised adults over 18 years of age, should get one every year. Outside of this, boosters are not recommended but are available to all Australian adults and to children who are severely immunocompromised.Plot twist: Experts admit that the reason everyone needs another booster is that vaccinating against a fast-mutating coronavirus doesn’t work super well. “The virus gradually evolves so that some of its proteins are a little bit different so that it can avoid the antibodies that we’ve now got present at population level,” says one. “In this case, we’ve got mutations in the spike protein that seems to be making it easier for this virus to attach to our cells and it seems to be making this virus evade our antibodies better,“ says another.Flashback montage: Every expert who warned of immune imprinting, immune suppression, immune tolerance, the role of vaccines in driving new variants, vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAEDs), and the general futility of vaccinating against respiratory viruses. Slow roll a peer-reviewed article co-authored by Dr Anthony Fauci concluding that, “Durably protective vaccines against non-systemic mucosal respiratory viruses with high mortality rates have thus far eluded vaccine development efforts.”Comic relief: Like the good lackeys they are, media outlets are beating up the BREAKING new variant story, to which the general public response has been LMAO.An online Murdoch media poll indicates three-quarters of their readers just aren’t interested.Denouement: Collective apathy. The failure of this latest scare campaign is unlikely to preclude a thirteenth scare campaign, as the government is generally unresponsive to market feedback, and it has mRNA investments and purchase commitments driving its decision-making.Media will continue to uncritically print government press releases provided they convert to clicks – LMAO or otherwise.Expect the next installment just in time for the summer Covid wave.Republished from the author’s Substack Tyler DurdenWed, 06/25/2025 - 21:45",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/new-covid-wave-scare-campaign-massive-flop,business,

2025-06-26 01:35:59,Treasury yields fall as concerns grow over Trump's criticism of Powell,"U.S. Treasury yields were lower on Thursday amid renewed concerns that President Donald Trump is considering replacing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.At 4:31 a.m. ET, the 10-year Treasury yield fell 2 basis points to 4.27%, while the 2-year yield was lower over a basis point to 3.76%. The 30-year yield shed 2 basis points to 4.82%.One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.On Wednesday, Powell spoke before the Senate Banking Committee and reiterated that the central bank’s main goal was to keep inflation in check, as the effects of Trump’s tariffs still remain unclear.Powell’s insistence on holding rates steady has drawn harsh criticism from Trump, who again threatened on Wednesday that he’s considering replacing the central bank leader sooner than expected, per a report from The Wall Street Journal.The president is expecting to pick and announce Powell’s replacement by September or October, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.“He goes out pretty soon, fortunately, because I think he’s terrible,” Trump said on Wednesday during a press conference at the NATO summit. “I know within three or four people who I’m going to pick.”Investors are anticipating May’s personal consumption expenditures index on Friday. Powell said Tuesday that the Fed’s preferred inflation measure is expected to rise to 2.3%, while the core measure that excludes food and energy is expected to tick up to 2.6%. That’s up from 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively, in April.They will also await weekly jobless claims data which is set to be released on Thursday morning.Elsewhere, investors are monitoring tensions in the Middle East, since Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which has held after initial violations.",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/treasury-yields-fall-as-concerns-grow-over-trumps-criticism-of-powell/3856568/,business,

Hawley, speaking Monday at the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, warned about the cartel-like grip that mega-corps such as JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill, and National Beef have on the nation's beef supply chain. ""Four companies currently control over 80% of beef processing in this country and very similarly high shares of poultry and pork. In Missouri, just in the last year, we have had two poultry plants closed by the dominant. Poultry processor Tyson Food canceling contracts with farmers putting hundreds of people out of work across my state really acting with total impunity why ... because they can because they they are essentially a monopolist,"" Hawley said. Hawley asked Federal Trade Commissioner Mark Meador: ""Is this kind of thing [beef monopoly] that the FTC can take action on?"" Meador responded, ""Yes, with the small caveat that the Department of Justice typically handles the packers but the FTC sees this at the retail level as well. When there are a smaller number of packers, retailers pay higher prices, and then consumers pay higher prices, and then retailers want to merge and consolidate their own part of the supply chain to counteract that, and then it's sort of an arms race to see who can get the biggest, the fastest."" Hawley noted, ""I'll end with this right now beef processing is just one example but it's a perfect example for a state like mine the only people who win are the monopolists - you know if you're a cattle rancher you're not getting paid for your product - if you are a consumer at the grocery store you're paying an arm and a leg for some hamburger - yet so the consumers are paying more the farmers are getting paid less who is making out like a bandit here? It's the monopolists, it's the four companies that control 80% of beef processing, that is not competition. We need more competition in this country, economy-wide."" On X, Hawley called for ""more industry competition in America."" A total of 4 companies control a whopping 80% of the entire beef-processing industry. That's a modern-day monopoly.The winners here? The monopolists - like Tyson Foods. The losers? Farmers & grocery shoppers.We need more industry competition in America pic.twitter.com/UxZc7eoAOZ— Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) June 24, 2025More hereHawley is right. And here at ZeroHedge, we've been at the forefront of sounding the alarm on America's imploding food sovereignty. With two of the Big Four beef processors—JBS and National Beef—foreign-owned, it's only a matter of time before Washington wakes up to the national security threat that poses. The answer? A grassroots revival of regional microprocessors—a decentralized, community-driven push to take back control of the food supply chain from globalist monopolists and put it where it belongs: in the hands of ranchers nationwide. A network of smaller processors adds redundancy, preventing catastrophic bottlenecks, such as what we saw during the early days of the Covid pandemic. When one large meat plant goes offline, the entire national supply chain is thrown into chaos.Regional processors would provide alternative outlets for ranchers and farmers to sell cattle at higher prices, helping to revive rural economies and preserve family farms. The move to support local ranchers will only gain momentum under the MAHA movement. Know your rancher.

2025-06-26 02:42:43,Live updates: Hegseth will hold new conference to respond to intelligence report on Iran strikes,"Ikea planned to cut meal prices by half during weekdays, in addition to free meals for children. The Swedish retail giant also planned to introduce new items catering to Asian cuisine and flavors. Outside its food retail business, Ikea is also looking to expand its home furnishing product range to tap into China’s growing elder population.Ikea shoppers will see price cuts of up to 50% at many of the company’s restaurants globally, as the Swedish retail giant aims to attract cost-conscious consumers.The steep price cuts will be a temporary measure to help consumers “stretch their budgets” at a time of heightened economic uncertainty and high cost-of-living pressure, the company said, without specifying when the cuts will come into effect. The home and furniture retailer said it would also offer free meals for children.“Consumer confidence has decreased. People are holding on to the money that they have in their pockets or in savings,” Tolga Öncü, COO at Ikea Retail, told CNBC’s Emily Tan Wednesday.The flat-pack furniture seller slashed wholesale prices by an average of 15% last year, allowing retailers to cut prices for consumers.Efforts to enhance affordability cost 2.1 billion euros to the company last year, according to Öncü, even as lower prices saw revenue drop about 9% and retail sales decline 5.3%.Ikea also plans to open 58 new stores globally during fiscal year 2025 ending in August, with its first outlet in Seoul — fifth in South Korea — up and running since April.By cutting prices so deeply, Ikea is bucking the trend as a slew of Western retail brands have warned of price hikes, passing onto consumers part of the higher duty costs importing into the U.S.Retail giants such as Walmart, Target, Costco and Nike said in their latest quarterly earnings reports that they have already raised prices or plan to do so in the coming weeks.Although global firms took a sigh of relief after the Trump administration had suspended sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs for three months and struck a preliminary deal with China, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in May that “we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.”Ikea is not “immune” to the higher tariffs, which are expected to fuel inflation and weigh on consumer confidence, said Öncü, although it has been able to “somewhat absorb the impact and not pass on the total impact to customers in the U.S.”The price reductions are, however, an urgent need in China — a key market for Ikea — where local businesses are cutting prices aggressively to stay competitive and attract customers amid sluggish consumer demand.Ikea has 39 stores in China, although the share of its global sales in the country has been sliding in recent years and was at 3.5% in 2023-24 financial year.“Big-ticket demand in China will be held back by decreased consumer confidence,” said John Mercer, head of global research for Coresight Research. Mercer pointed out that “economic optimism” among China-based consumers fell to its lowest level in well over two years in May.“There will be limits to how much a big-ticket retailer can stimulate demand in an uncertain context, but an aggressive price stance is likely to support market-share gains as cautious consumers trade down,” Mercer added.Retailers in China are betting big on food and beverage as one of the few offline segments where consumers continue to spend, though with less emphasis on value and cost, said a marketing agency advising European brands operating in China.Outside the food business, Ikea is also looking to expand its home furnishing product range to tap into China’s growing elder population.Öncü emphasized the need to tap into China’s “silver economy” — a sector that provides goods and services for people over 50.Economists estimate that by 2040, around 30% of China’s population will be over 60 years old, compared to about 15% in 2024. The elderly population will also present a promising market opportunity as they tend to be more financially sound, having accumulated wealth along with China’s economic rise.“Multi-generational homes are increasing. That’s why we have introduced the new bedding and range. We are now testing to answer to those needs that has come from the silver economy in China,” Öncü said.“If anyone knows how to cater to global consumers with a highly price-competitive offer in furniture and furnishings, it’s IKEA,” Coresight’s Mercer said, but “whether planned price cuts will be sustainable is for IKEA to determine.”The Swedish company said it also planned to introduce new items catering to Asian cuisine and flavors, which it hoped would bring in around 8 million new customers.“We will soon launch our very first falafel, adding this popular food to our restaurants, and later, to our Swedish food markets,” Lorena Lourido Gomez, global food manager at Ingka Group, the worldwide franchiser for the brand, said in a statement.",necn,https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/president-trump/live-updates-trump-administration-iran-israel-congress-june-26-2025-live-updates/3752377/,politics,

The broad market index climbed 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 153 points, or, 0.4%.The S&P 500 traded about 0.5% below its intraday record high of 6,147.43 reached in February. . It’s also near its closing all-time high of 6,144.15. The index has jumped more than 20% since hitting a closing low in April at the peak of the U.S. tariff scare. Trade pressures have eased since then, but some on Wall Street are skeptical that the recent market momentum will carry on.“The various macro factors that I’m looking at seem to suggest that there’s no way this situation can continue,” Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, said on CNBC’s “Power Lunch” Wednesday, citing the Israel-Iran conflict as well as President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the impact of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on the fiscal deficit.Elsewhere, Initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21 pulled back to 236,000, which was below the 244,000 consensus estimate. The data is indicative of a still-strong economy that seems to be holding up.Tensions in the Middle East seemed to ease after Trump said Tuesday that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was in effect.

That was below the 244,000 estimate, though continuing claims held at their highest since November 2021.Durable goods orders, which includes items such as airplanes, appliances and computers, surged 16.4% in May after falling 6.6% in April, the Commerce Department said. Excluding transportation, orders increased just 0.5%, though they were still up 15.5% excluding defense. The headline number was much better than the 7.5% estimate.First-quarter gross domestic product contracted at a 0.5% annualized pace, according to the last of three Commerce Department estimates that was lower than the 0.2% decline previously reported. The department attributed the fall to downward revisions in consumer spending and exports, offset somewhat by a downward revision to imports. —Jeff CoxMicron, Kratos highlight premarket moversHere are a few of the stocks making notable moves ahead of the opening bell:Micron Technology — The chipmaker rose 2% after its fiscal-third quarter financial results topped expectations. Micron’s adjusted earnings were $1.91 per share, versus the $1.60 cents expected from analysts polled by LSEG. Revenue was $9.3 billion, above the $8.87 billion consensus estimate.Kratos Defense and Security Solutions — The military tech stock fell nearly 7% after Kratos said it would sell $500 million of stock. The company said the money raised could be used for capital spending, among other uses.McCormick — The food spices stock rose more than 4% after adjusted earnings for the second quarter beat expectations. McCormick earned 69 cents per share, excluding items, while analysts were looking for 66 cents, according to LSEG.Check out more movers here.— Jesse PoundCiti upgrades Truist Financial to buy rating from neutralIn a Thursday note, Citi upgraded Truist Financial to a buy rating from neutral. Analyst Keith Horowitz accompanied the upgrade by lifting his target price to $55 per share from $44.Shares of Truist Financial are down 5% on the year.“Too much value on table to ignore,” Horowitz wrote. “We see tailwinds from ability to increase in buy backs due to strong capital position and cheap share price relative to intrinsic value.”A rebound in capital markets activity leading fee growth could further boost shares of Truist Financial, especially as the company’s return on tangible common equity increases over the next two years. Horowitz added that Truist also looks attractive from a valuation standpoint.“The stock continues to trade at a discount to our universe on our implied cost of equity metric and sentiment is increasingly bearish, setting relative bar and creating an attractive entry point,” he said.— Lisa Kailai HanCitizens Bank upgrades gambling stock Penn Entertainment to outperformCitizens Bank believes that Penn Entertainment is reaching a turning point for the better.In a Thursday note, analyst Jordan Bender upgraded the gambling stock to a market outperform rating from market perform. He simultaneously introduced a price target of $24, implying the stock could rally 38% from here.Shares of Penn Entertainment have slipped 12% in 2025.“After several years of overpromising and underdelivering, leading to a bloated cost structure and balance sheet, we see the light at the end of the tunnel. Several catalysts, including casino openings/growth and shareholder returns, should bridge PENN into 2026, whereby the digital business turns into a call option for value, in our view,” he wrote. “The stock is down 87% from its all-time high (Russell 3000 -1%), yet we are nearing an inflection point in the story whereby we see 38% upside in shares.”Bender added that current-quarter data has highlighted resiliency for Penn, despite a turbulent economic backdrop. Meanwhile, the company is also positioned as one of the “more favorable regional gaming companies in the space.”— Lisa Kailai HanDollar Index falls to three year low The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Thursday to its lowest level in more than three years.The move comes as President Donald Trump is reportedly toying with nominating current Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s replacement as soon as the fall, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

To say Wall Street isn’t a fan of Zohran Mamdani would be an understatement.In fact, high-profile investors and business leaders in the Big Apple are up in arms about the stunning win by the democratic socialist in the primary to win the Democratic nomination to serve as the next New York City mayor. The three-term Assemblymember’s potential victory in the November general election could bring what the Street hates most — tax hikes and tighter regulation threatening corporate and investment interests.Philippe Laffont, founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, told CNBC that a Mamdani win could trigger another exodus of wealthy investors. Since the pandemic, a wave of wealthy residents and institutional firms have fled the nation’s largest city for low-tax states such as Florida and Texas.“Some people are going to, for sure, go,” Laffont said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Wednesday after former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded the Democratic nomination. “It’s not quite done yet.

2025-06-26 00:01:01,Republicans suddenly realize voters hate their health care cuts,"New disclosures from Republican lawmakers reveal concerns within the party that voters may punish the GOP if proposed cuts to health care in the Donald Trump-backed “One Big, Beautiful Bill” become law. The measure, which squeaked through the House without any Democratic support late last month, is currently under consideration in the Senate.Politico reported on Wednesday that House Speaker Mike Johnson is telling Senate Republican leadership that he fears the party could lose its razor-thin majority if further cuts to Medicaid are added.The outlet reports that Senate Majority Leader John Thune is “under immense pressure to water down the Medicaid provisions the Senate GOP is counting on for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of savings.”Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has also been sounding the alarm for his party.The Hill reported that Tillis told Thune that the proposed cuts could lead to Republicans losing the House and the Senate. A source who witnessed the discussion told the outlet that Tillis discussed how the GOP proposal would cut services in his home state and told Thune, “this will be devastating to my state.”Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina speaks during a confirmation hearing at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 29.Tillis is up for reelection in 2026 and is one of the Republican Party’s most vulnerable Senate candidates. He won his 2020 race by less than 2 percentage points, and while Trump won North Carolina in 2024, the state has been decided by less than 4 percentage points in the past five presidential elections.Additional pressure is being exerted on Republicans from within by a group of over a dozen House Republicans. The members, who hold vulnerable seats, sent a letter to Thune and Johnson on Tuesday, saying they wouldn’t back a revised bill that included more health care cuts.Thune’s predecessor in Senate leadership, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is also trying to prevent his party from getting more bad headlines over health care. After it was reported that McConnell said in a private meeting that voters would “get over it,” referring to the cuts, his spokesperson tried to claim his comments referred to people purportedly abusing Medicaid benefits.Republicans have been trying to convince the public that the proposed cuts will not affect the public at large, but this is false. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 16 million would lose care under the bill. Even though public opinion polls show Americans opposed to the bill’s provisions, Trump is already planning a victory party to celebrate the bill’s passage. The party’s congressional campaign committee also plans to attack Democrats for voting against it.Democratic leaders like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have been lambasting Republicans over the bill, with an emphasis on the massive impact it will have on day-to-day life for millions.xMore than 16 million people will lose their health care under Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”That's enough people to fill Fenway Park 424 times.— Elizabeth Warren (@warren.senate.gov) 2025-06-25T18:09:55.286ZTrump has a lot riding on the legislative success of the bill.In his first term, two of his most humiliating moments came after the failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his inability to pass an infrastructure bill (though former President Joe Biden passed one).

2025-06-27 04:30:18,Chinese battery giant and Tesla supplier CATL is expanding globally: Here's why it matters,"China’s CATL is a key player in the global transition to more sustainable transport, with a market share in the EV sector of roughly 38%. The battery maker is intensifying its global expansion efforts on the back of a blockbuster public offering. CATL also plans to roll out its battery-swapping and recycling technology to Europe, a move that could shake-up the regional market.The world’s largest electric vehicle (EV) is going all-in on international expansion and could shake up the EV market in the process with its battery-swapping tech rollout. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) is a key player in the global transition to more sustainable transport, with a market share in the EV sector of roughly 38%. CATL’s clients include global players like Tesla, Volkswagen and BMW, with the firm boasting technology far superior to that of Western competitors. Despite its outsized impact on the EV industry, the company had mostly flown under the radar until May this year, when it launched the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2025 to date in Hong Kong. The IPO raised 41 billion Hong Kong dollars ($5.2 billion), after CATL stocks surged and an over-allotment option was fully exercised. Here is what CATL has in the works following its IPO.Global expansionAhead of its public offering, CATL said 90% of the funds raised by going public would be put toward its expansion into Europe, particularly its under-construction factory in Hungary. The company’s 7.6-billion-euro ($8.2 billion) investment into the Debrecen battery plant was first announced in August 2022 and is expected to begin production this year. The battery maker has already established a wholly owned manufacturing base in Germany, which first opened in 2023. It has also announced plans to build a battery plant in Spain through a joint venture with Stellantis. CATL’s global investments follow a trend of more Chinese EV companies, including auto giant BYD, shifting to Europe amid aggressive competition and price wars in the domestic market. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesVisitors visit the CATL booth at the 21st Changchun International Automobile Expo in Changchun, Jilin province, China, July 17, 2024.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China, on Thursday, Ni Jun, CATL’s chief manufacturing officer, said the brutal discount war would not end without intervention from Beijing. He added that, if a big player continues to cut prices, it could lead to other competitors being driven out of the market and create a monopoly. While CATL’s Jun did not name any companies, CATL’s main competitor BYD announced price cuts in late May. Tight margins and overcapacity in China have been a driving force in CATL’s Europe push, said Tu Le, founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights, adding that the company is already supplying “virtually every” EV maker in China, limiting domestic growth opportunities. But not everything in Europe has been easy. The bloc placed punitive tariffs on made-in-China EVs last year, following an even more severe crackdown in the U.S. Le said that the Hungary facility is another major step toward the company’s localization plans and that it will lead to lower labor costs and a geopolitically friendlier environment when compared to Germany. CATL is also involved in an integrated electric vehicle battery project in Indonesia. According to local media reports, government officials expect production to begin in March 2026, which could give CATL a presence in the growing EV market of Southeast Asia. Battery-swapping technologyCATL said in a recent interview with The Financial Times that it also plans to roll out its battery-swapping and recycling technology to Europe, in a move that could have significant ramifications for the regional market. CNBC has contacted CATL for further details. Modern battery-swapping technology, while popular in China, is yet to take off in Europe. Chinese EV maker and battery-swapping pioneer Nio is one exception. The company has introduced 60 battery swap stations across Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark.Jeep and Dodge maker Stellantis, meanwhile, recently partnered with U.S.-based Ample to integrate battery swapping technology to a fleet of 100 Fiat 500 EVs in Madrid, Spain.The experience of using a battery swap station is thought to be very similar to using an automated car wash. The EV driver parks the car on a platform with an integrated system, which removes the depleted battery from beneath the vehicle and replaces it with a fresh, fully charged one. The whole process takes about five minutes.Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesA visitor looks at an EVOGO battery-swap station of Chinese battery producer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited CATL during the 22nd China International Fair for Investment and Trade in Xiamen, southeast China’s Fujian Province, Sept. 8, 2022. Advocates of battery charging through a swapping station say the technology solves a number of issues, particularly relating to fast charging and long-term performance — two major sticking points for the widespread adoption of EVs.Analysts say another key benefit to swapping is that it allows car manufacturers to maintain ownership of the battery, which lowers the initial price of the vehicle and creates a regular revenue stream for the OEMs.Some drawbacks, however, include high initial infrastructure costs and a lack of standardization across car manufacturers.Connor Watts, battery raw materials analyst at consultancy Fastmarkets, said CATL, which has a number of partnerships with Chinese OEMs, is well positioned to implement the necessary level of product standardization across its customer base.“And particularly following its recent influx of cash from its Hong-Kong listing, it has the necessary capital to develop infrastructure within the European market,” Watts told CNBC by email.“Of companies that could succeed in developing the European battery swapping industry, none are better placed than CATL considering its market position,” he added.Read moreShares in China’s CATL jump over 16% in Hong Kong debut after biggest IPO of the yearGM unveils new ‘groundbreaking’ EV battery tech, aims to be first to marketBYD’s shares rally after rolling out new technology it claims charges EVs in five minutesJulia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and e-mobility supply chains at the campaign group Transport & Environment, said major carmakers would have to agree to a standardized cell design for battery-swapping technology to work at scale in Europe.“Battery swapping is a good addition to the charging space, and in some parts of the market it makes sense ... but it is not a silver bullet to solve our problems,” Poliscanova told CNBC by phone.“We will still need batteries and we will still need materials for them, whether they are swapped or whether they are in the car permanently,” she added.",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/chinese-battery-giant-and-tesla-supplier-catl-is-expanding-globally-heres-why-it-matters/3857453/,business,

The White House said the July 8 or 9 deadline for countries to make a trade deal and avoid President Donald Trump’s higher tariff rates could be extended. Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:1. Within reachThe S&P 500 is inches away from it’s all-time high after gaining ground on Thursday. Futures tied to the broad market index gained 0.2% in premarket trading Friday, building anticipation for a potential record day. It’s the culmination of a rapid comeback from tariff-driven lows in early April, with the S&P gaining more than 23% in fewer than three months. As of Thursday’s close it’s 0.1% below it’s all-time intraday high. Follow live market updates.2. SchnikesNike is staring down higher near-term costs brought on by tariffs. “With the new tariff rates in place today, we estimate a gross incremental cost increase to Nike of approximately $1 billion,” CFO Matt Friend said Thursday, referencing the 2026 fiscal year. He said Nike intends to “fully mitigate” those cost increases over time through price hikes and supply chain adjustments. The update came alongside Nike’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, in which it narrowly beat on the top and bottom lines. Nike shares were up about 9% in premarket trading.3. Drop deadlineAlex Wong | Getty ImagesCharts that show the “reciprocal tariffs” the U.S. is charging other countries are on display at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on April 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. And yet, the White House said Thursday the July 8 or 9 deadline for countries to make a trade deal and avoid President Donald Trump’s higher tariff rates could be extended. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the 90-day timeline — set in April when Trump paused his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” hours after they took effect — was “not critical.” The comments offer hope that the markets may be spared another round of trade-related turmoil like they experienced this spring. In other trade-deal news, China’s Ministry of Commerce on Friday confirmed details of a framework with the U.S. that would allow for rare earth exports and ease tech restrictions.4.

2025-06-27 04:00:01,​Here's how the luxury real estate market is splitting up,"Luxury real estate brokers are seeing more all-cash offers, especially from ultra-wealthy clients, per a new survey of Coldwell Banker brokers. Brokerage president Jason Waugh said high interest rates and real estate’s appeal as a safe haven during economic volatility are driving this trend. While high-end buyers aren’t shying away from big-ticket purchases, their wish-lists have gotten longer.A version of this article first appeared in CNBC’s Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.Economic uncertainty is creating a divide in the luxury real estate market between ultra-rich buyers and the merely wealthy, according to a new report from brokerage Coldwell Banker. A survey of some 200 agents specializing in luxury property found that ultra-wealthy buyers, defined as individuals worth at least $30 million, are still making big-ticket purchases despite trade war and recession fears. They are also driving a substantial rise in all-cash offers. Meanwhile, affluent but less wealthy buyers are more sensitive to interest rates and are acting more cautiously, according to the report.Just over half of the surveyed agents said they had seen a slight or substantial increase in cash purchases by clients in 2025. Only 3.9% reported a decrease in those buyers in the first five months of 2025, while 45.4% said cash purchases had held steady, according to the report.Jason Waugh, president of Coldwell Banker Affiliates, told Inside Wealth that high interest rates are a major factor behind the surge.“Cash provides a buyer with control. It provides leverage, speed and security,” he said. “But it’s really the elevated borrowing costs that continue to remain so high. Why absorb those costs if you have the cash to close on a real estate purchase, right?”Waugh, who got his broker license nearly 32 years ago, said real estate can be more attractive during times of economic uncertainty. Just over two-thirds of surveyed agents reported that affluent clients were maintaining or increasing their exposure to real estate, while only 11.3% said clients’ interest had decreased in favor of equities and other financial assets. The remaining 20.6% of agents said clients had put plans on hold due to economic or stock market uncertainty.“It’s been a roller coaster, and the business is cyclical. I think at the end of the day, real estate is a hard asset that can preserve wealth and is a hedge against inflation,” he said. “I think that data really confirms that narrative that folks see real estate as a great way to to accumulate wealth even in the the most uncertain and volatile economic environment we’ve navigated in well over a decade.” The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.

The report, citing data from the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing, said luxury single-family home sales dipped 4.7% year over year while attached property sales plummeted by 21.1%.Agents are also seeing more clients reduce list prices in 2025 compared to recent years, according to Waugh. The median sold prices for luxury single-family and luxury-attached properties currently stand at $1.7 million and $1.25 million, respectively, according to the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing.Waugh added that buyers at all price points are more discerning than they were a few years ago. They’re now asking for top-end appliances like smart fridges, spa-level amenities, and indoor-outdoor living features from a fireplace to a whole kitchen.First-time luxury buyers are especially choosy, he said.“They may be stretching themselves, given the current rate environment, so they’re going to be a lot more discerning in terms of evaluating where they live, the amenities, the condition of the property at move in,” he said. “It’s a completely new environment this year than the prior couple years.”",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/heres-how-the-luxury-real-estate-market-is-splitting-up/3857442/,business,

2025-06-27 03:25:00,"VDH: In the End, Everyone Hated The Iranian Theocracy","VDH: In the End, Everyone Hated The Iranian Theocracy Authored by Victor Davis Hanson via AmericanGreatness.com,It is hard even to digest the incredible train of events of the last few days in the Middle East.Iran had been reduced to an anemic, performance-art missile attack on our base in Qatar—the last Parthian shot from a terrified regime, desperate for an out—and a ceasefire.Iran would have been better off not launching such a ceremonial but ultimately humiliating proof of impotence.Even worse for the theocracy, Iran’s temporary reprieve came from the now magnanimous but still hated Donald Trump.So ends the creepy mystique of the supposedly indomitable terror state of Iran, the bane of the last seven American presidents over half a century.For Supreme Leader Khamenei, it was hard to swallow that U.S. bombers got their permission to fly into Iranian airspace from the Israeli air force.A good simile is that Trump put a pot of water on the stove, told Iran to jump in, put the lid over them, then smiled, turned up the heat—and will now let them stew.As postbellum realities now simmer in Iran, the theocracy is left explaining the inexplicable to its humiliated military and shocked but soon-to-be-furious populace. All the regime’s blood-curdling rhetoric, apocalyptic threats against Israel, goose-stepping thugs, and shiny new missiles ended in less than nothing.A trillion dollars and five decades’ worth of missiles and centrifuges are now up in smoke. That money might have otherwise saved Iranians from the impoverishment of the last fifty years.How about the little Satan Israel, to which Iran for nearly 50 years promised extinction?Israel had destroyed Iran’s expeditionary terrorists, Iran’s defenses, its nuclear viability, and the absurd mythology of Iranian military competence. And worse, Israel showed it could repeat all that destruction when and if it is necessary.So, the most hated regime in the world crawled into the boiling pot because it looked around in vain for someone to void Trump’s ultimatum for a cease and desist.But there were no last-minute saviors to rescue them.The dreaded decades-long Iranian nuclear threat?It is either gone for now, or if it resurfaces, it will be again far easier to vaporize at will than to rebuild a lost trillion-dollar investment.Russia? Its former Obama-Kerry re-invitation back into the Middle East lasted only a decade.It will now cut its losses like it did with the vanished Assad kleptocracy in Syria. Putin exits the Middle East not entirely displeased that his lunatic Iranian client did not get a bomb—but did get its just desserts. A tense Middle East tends to prop up Russian export oil prices.Did China come to the mullahs’ aid?No, they were not shy about ordering their Iranian lackey to keep the Strait of Hormuz open, through which 50 percent of Chinese-purchased oil passes.For President Xi, the Iranians are treated as little more than Uyghurs with oil.The world decided that it was tired of a half-century of crybully terrorism, empty nuke threats, mindless mobs screaming scripted banalities, cowardly murdering, and medieval theocrats threatening the general peace.So, the world turned its back on Iran. And with a wink and nod, it let Israel and the U.S. do what they must.As for Iran’s terrorist appendages, Hezbollah’s commanders are either dead, maimed, or in hiding.Hamas has fled into a subterranean labyrinth.The last Assad thug fled to Russia.The crazy Houthis? They are reconsidering the idea of launching their last missile at the cost of their last port or power grid.The anti-Trump Democrats and loony left?Their talk of impeaching Trump for the supposedly “illegal” 35-minute, one-off strike will fade.The Trump mission equaled less than one day of Obama’s predator drone strikes, targeted killings, or his five-year chaotic bombing in Libya.Is the incoherent left furious that there is no more Iranian nuclear threat?Mad that no Americans were killed last Saturday night?Furious America likely killed few if any Iranians.Or is it raging because Trump ignored Iran’s last-gasp attack and instead orchestrated a cease-fire?Of course, in the Middle East, there is never a real end to anything.We may see freelancing terrorists try to fill the vacuum of Iran’s decline. Or Iran itself may try to let loose a terrorist cell. It may later boast it has hidden away some enriched uranium.But no matter.The dimensions of this new Middle East will persist.The new reality is that either Israel or the U.S.—if they keep their earned confidence within proper limits—can now ensure a non-nuclear Iran by easily blowing up its costly nuclear program as often as it is rebuilt.Views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.

2025-06-27 03:00:00,Chinese Influence In Climate Change Lawsuits Threatens To Derail U.S. Energy Industry,"Chinese Influence In Climate Change Lawsuits Threatens To Derail U.S. Energy Industry A new op-ed from oil services CEO Dan Eberhart in Forbes makes the case that climate change litigation is a growing threat to U.S. energy - and that the U.S. could fall behind China as a result.He notes that Senator Ted Cruz has repeatedly voiced concern that American energy security is under threat—not from foreign armies or economic collapse, but from a coordinated legal campaign masquerading as environmental activism. This week, Cruz’s Judiciary oversight subcommittee is convening a hearing to dig into what he believes is a coordinated effort between China and the U.S. climate litigation movement aimed at undercutting U.S. energy dominance.According to Eberhart's piece in Forbes, the wave of climate lawsuits, particularly those brought by firms like Sher Edling, are supported by a network of well-funded foundations and advocacy organizations. These entities, he argues, may be unintentionally serving the strategic goals of America's geopolitical adversaries—especially China—by hampering domestic fossil fuel production and increasing reliance on foreign-controlled clean energy supply chains.Eberhart points out that China already dominates global markets for critical materials like lithium and cobalt, as well as solar and battery manufacturing. So, any U.S. policy that accelerates a transition away from fossil fuels without securing domestic alternatives, he warns, risks handing Beijing the upper hand in both energy and manufacturing.The national security implications are becoming harder to ignore. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission has raised alarms that the Chinese Communist Party is working to influence U.S. state and local policy to advance its global agenda. A report from the nonprofit State Armor further claims that China has infiltrated segments of the American environmental movement to steer energy policy in a way that aligns with Chinese interests.One organization receiving particular scrutiny is the Energy Foundation China (EFC). Though it’s officially based in San Francisco, most of its staff are located in Beijing, and its activities reportedly align closely with CCP goals. Eberhart notes that EFC has funneled millions into U.S. anti-fossil fuel groups, including the Rocky Mountain Institute and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)—the latter of which faced a 2018 congressional inquiry over potential foreign agent registration.Concerns about Chinese influence don’t stop with advocacy groups. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has previously warned that Beijing is exploiting social and political divisions in America to steer energy policy in its favor. Several major U.S. philanthropic institutions—including the Rockefeller, Hewlett, and MacArthur foundations—have funded environmental litigation efforts that Eberhart believes would never have gained traction without their financial support. However, these donors have largely ignored the risks of foreign manipulation embedded in the groups they help fund.The influence campaign, Eberhart claims, also extends into academia. Chinese government-affiliated institutions like the National Natural Science Foundation of China have published research in U.S. journals criticizing fossil fuels and painting American companies as deceptive. Notably, one of EFC’s top communications staffers once worked at this same Chinese foundation.Meanwhile, what Eberhart calls a “revolving door” between activist nonprofits and federal agencies raises further ethical concerns. For instance, Ann Carlson, now serving in the Biden administration, previously consulted for Sher Edling while also sitting on the board of the Environmental Law Institute—a group that has partnered with Chinese organizations on legal education initiatives tied to climate litigation.Eberhart argues that the Senate subcommittee led by Sen. Cruz is uniquely positioned to investigate the network of foreign and domestic actors behind the legal assault on American energy. Transparency, he writes, is crucial. Americans deserve to know who is funding these lawsuits and why. Otherwise, he warns, efforts to revive the “energy dominance” doctrine promoted during the Trump administration may not be enough to overcome what he sees as an opaque and potentially dangerous campaign.While the U.S. debates and litigates its energy future, Eberhart cautions, China is rapidly building coal plants, securing fossil fuel deals, and tightening its grip on clean energy supply chains. If current trends continue, Beijing may find itself in a commanding position—while the U.S. energy sector is entangled in regulation, litigation, and foreign dependency.It's almost as if all of this progressive ""activism"" really was put in place to set us in motion backwards...

2025-06-27 02:35:00,Cancer Patients Recover By Taking Repurposed Anti-Parasitic Drugs,"Cancer Patients Recover By Taking Repurposed Anti-Parasitic Drugs Authored by Huey Freeman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),Joe Tippens never planned to discover a potential remedy that he credits with saving his life and thrust him into the spotlight among notable cancer survivors. The 67-year-old businessman told The Epoch Times he just wanted to beat a type of cancer with an extremely low survival rate.Illustration by The Epoch TimesIn August 2016, Tippens was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer with a fist-sized tumor. After undergoing chemotherapy and radiation five times a week in Houston, the large tumor in his left lung was eliminated. However, Tippens said the treatments came closer to killing him than curing him.When he returned home to Oklahoma after the New Year, he received devastating news. His oncologist told him he had zero chance of surviving for more than a few months.“In January of 2017, my PET scan lit up like a Christmas tree and I had wide metastasis everywhere, including in my neck, bones, pancreas, and liver,” Tippens said.Finding a LifelineFacing a prognosis of three months to live, Tippens heard an intriguing story from a veterinarian he knew: A scientist with terminal cancer reportedly cured her lab mice and then herself using fenbendazole, an antiparasitic drug.The story was the beginning of what eventually became the “Joe Tippens Protocol.”Fenbendazole, used for 30 years to treat intestinal parasites in animals, has not received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for human use, meaning doctors cannot prescribe it for people. However, with a terminal diagnosis and nothing to lose, Tippens decided to try it alongside his conventional treatments.Tippens found that Panacur, a trade name for fenbendazole, was sold over the counter at outlets that carry veterinary medications.Starting in the third week of January 2017, Tippens began taking the canine medication, Panacur, 1 gram per day for three consecutive days per week. After four days without the medication, which contains about 222 milligrams of fenbendazole per gram, he would repeat his three-day routine. Three months later, Tippens was cancer-free.His protocol also included Theracurmin, a form of the active compound in turmeric, and CBD, an extract of cannabis which does not cause intoxication.Scientific Support and MechanismsDr. William Makis, an oncologist and cancer researcher based in Edmonton, Canada, has studied Tippens’s approach and treats cancer patients worldwide, primarily through telehealth.“I’ve had several patients declared cancer-free after doing the protocol for a number of months,” Makis told The Epoch Times. “What made [Tippens’] situation so powerful is that he cured himself of a cancer that is very aggressive—small cell lung cancer—and he had a terminal diagnosis.”According to Makis, the family of anti-parasitic drugs that includes fenbendazole, mebendazole, and albendazole works well—scientists have found at least 12 ways the medications can fight cancer.The effectiveness of the drugs stems from key similarities between parasite and cancer cells: both have the capacity for autonomous survival and proliferation, resistance to cell-death pathways, and the ability to circumvent the host immune system.Anti-parasitic drugs appear to fight cancer through multiple mechanisms:Boosting protein called p53: P53 is a tumor suppressor protein that helps kill cancer cells.Blocking glucose uptake: Cancer cells depend on sugar for energy and growth.Disrupting microtubules: These cellular structures are crucial for cell division of cancer cells.Affecting mitochondrial function: Depletes cellular energy, increases oxidative stress, and blocks a critical pathway that regulates cell growth of cancer cells.Researchers at the Stanford University Medical Center have reported several case reports, using fenbendazole to cure Stage 4 cancer cases, Makis said. The series of case reports was published in 2021 in SciTechnol, an online, London-based publisher of scientific journal articles.A thought-provoking review citing animal studies published in 2024 in Anticancer Research Journal concluded that fenbendazole affects energy metabolism—mainly by increasing the levels of p53 and affecting pathways that control sugar uptake. It ultimately starves cancer cells and causes them to die with minimal harm to normal cells. The researchers concluded that fenbendazole’s effects on energy metabolism “could lead to significant advances in cancer treatment.”Some preliminary research also suggested potential anti-cancer mechanisms for fenbendazole. A study published in Scientific Reports in 2018 by researchers in India found that fenbendazole “may be evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent because of its effect on multiple cellular pathways leading to effective elimination of cancer cells.” Specifically, fenbendazole interferes with microtubules involved in cell division.A 2016 study published in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications found that ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug approved for human use, shows promise against glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer known for treatment resistance. The drug kills glioblastoma cells and inhibits blood vessel development. In laboratory and mouse studies, ivermectin triggers cancer cell death and significantly reduces tumor growth.Recent research has shown that a combination of fenbendazole and diisopropylamino dichloroacetate, a compound used to treat hepatitis, has shown some anticancer properties in cell cultures and animal studies. Combined, the drugs kill lung cancer cells more effectively than either drug alone.Makis has found that combining fenbendazole with ivermectin can increase the protocol’s effectiveness.“When you combine them, you go from attacking cancer in a dozen ways to attacking cancer in two dozen ways,” Makis said. “I have found it very reasonable to include both of them in protocols if there is pre-clinical research that each of them has an effect [on] that particular type of cancer. Whenever you have a specific cancer, I want to look at the body of research to see if there is a proven effect of either ivermectin or fenbendazole for that type of cancer. If there is, then I share that research with my patients.”Makis has treated patients with various cancers—from common types like breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancer to rarer forms such as cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) and sarcomas (soft tissue cancers). “I’ve had several patients declared cancer-free after doing the protocol for a number of months,” Makis said.Although Makis has been recommending ivermectin and fenbendazole for cancer treatment, he acknowledges that many doctors refrain from this practice.Doctors are very hesitant to help cancer patients with repurposed drugs because of repercussions from the medical boards, Makis said.“On the other hand, you have doctors who are willing to help patients with repurposed drugs but no experience with oncology,” he said.When asked whether he recommends that cancer patients consult with an integrative physician who approves of those treatments, Makis said it is good for a patient to have a relationship with a doctor who has experience with oncology.“It depends on the physician’s background,” Makis said. “Some doctors have extensive experience, after seeing cancer patients for many years.”Patient Success StoriesDonna Leland, 64, a show host on the national Moody Radio Network, was diagnosed with Stage 3 cervical and endometrial cancer in April 2023. She underwent a hysterectomy but declined the recommended chemotherapy and radiation.“I had seen the outcome for other people who had gone that route,” Leland told The Epoch Times. “Some had gotten all cleared, but then the cancer came back. I know it diminishes your own immune system’s ability to fight off disease.”Leland told the doctor she did not want those treatments and asked for another option. But she was offered nothing else.“I knew there had to be a better way than to fry everything. I just said, ‘I’d rather die than fry.’”Leland began taking fenbendazole and ivermectin. She also found support from Terry Harmon, a chiropractor and functional medicine physician in Kentucky.Harmon says more than 100 of his patients have reported positive health benefits from using fenbendazole or ivermectin.“The reason so many people are finding success is twofold,” Harmon told The Epoch Times. “It is addressing infections.

There is research showing this combination helps the body’s ability genetically to kill cancer and prevent cancer from growing and spreading.”Leland said she had confirmation of the effectiveness of these alternative treatments from studies on ivermectin, fenbendazole, and other anti-parasitic drugs. Mebendazole is another anti-parasitic drug that both Makis and Harmon recommended as an effective cancer treatment.One year after her hysterectomy, Leland said she is healthier than she has ever been, partly because of her continuing use of anti-parasitic drugs for preventive purposes.“After being checked every three months for evidence of cancer, my oncologist continues to declare me cancer-free.”“I feel like I’m 20 years younger,” Leland said. “God has been faithful to lead me on this journey.”Global ImpactThe Tippens Protocol has achieved significant international reach, particularly in China, where a translated blog has garnered more than 20 million views. This has led to an estimated 70,000 followers of what’s affectionately called the “Uncle Joey Protocol.”Despite opportunities to monetize his discovery, Tippens has refused all financial gain.“I have had search engine experts who have told me I could monetize this blog to the tune of $25,000 to $30,000 per month,” he said. “I can’t do that for a simple reason: I have hundreds of people who have told me the reason they believe me and trust me is because I am doing all this and not monetizing it. The second I monetized it, I would be just another guy out there hawking product out on the Internet, trying to make money.”Tippens warns about fraudulent Facebook pages that falsely use his name to sell substandard drugs.Regulatory and Medical ChallengesThe FDA confirmed that it has not approved “drug products containing fenbendazole for use in humans,” said Lauren-Jei McCarthy, FDA press officer, in a statement to The Epoch Times. It has not gone through the rigorous testing and clinical trials required for drugs intended for human use. Fenbendazole is approved by the FDA as an antiparasitic drug for use in animals. It is commonly used to deworm dogs, cats, horses, and cattle.Ivermectin, while FDA-approved for human use against parasitic worms, is not approved for cancer treatment. Health care providers may prescribe ivermectin to fight cancer as a repurposed medication. Both medications are available without prescriptions and are routinely purchased for veterinary use.Makis, who has been at the cutting edge of advocating for holistic treatments that include the repurposed drugs, said he believes we are in a revolutionary era of effective cancer treatments.“This is the first time in several generations there is a strong movement for true medical freedom, to allow for exploration of treatments that don’t benefit any big company,” he said.Serious side effects from fenbendazole and ivermectin are rare, Makis said.“I have seen moderate side effects, which include unpleasant visual symptoms, some dizziness, and fatigue,” Makis said.Tippens is encouraged by ongoing research into other FDA-approved drugs that might be repurposed for cancer treatment.“Because of my story, I think there are other efforts in research in the anti-parasitic category,“ Tippen said. ”There are seven sister drugs to fenbendazole. One medical group has used mebendazole in their protocol. I think I’ve started at least opening people’s brains to something.” Tyler DurdenThu, 06/26/2025 - 22:35",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/cancer-patients-recover-taking-repurposed-anti-parasitic-drugs,business,

2025-06-27 02:30:01,CNBC Daily Open: Wall Street is tuning out the noise and catching rays,"SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said he is “all in” on OpenAI, with its planned investments in the company reaching about 4.8 trillion Japanese yen ($33.2 billion). “I think that OpenAI will be listed eventually and, in my belief, will become the most valuable company in the world,” Son said at a shareholders’ meeting. He revealed he had wanted to be an early investor in OpenAI but ultimately lost out to Microsoft.SoftBank is “all in” on OpenAI, CEO Masayoshi Son said on Friday, as the Japanese tech giant looks to realize its vision of “artificial superintelligence.”This year, the Japanese multinational conglomerate has been increasing its investments in OpenAI and participating in joint ventures such as the $500 billion Stargate project. According to Son, SoftBank is now “all in” on the artificial intelligence company, with total planned investments in the company reaching about 4.8 trillion Japanese yen ($33.2 billion), despite it being unlisted and unprofitable.“I think that OpenAI will be listed eventually and, in my belief, will become the most valuable company in the world,” Son said. He added, however, that it “takes bravery to invest” in such a company. As it turns out, Son has long held that conviction. During the shareholders’ meeting, he revealed that before 2019, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had asked him if SoftBank would invest $10 billion into the company.“I said, yes, I would ... I was serious because I had financial resources thanks to Vision Fund’s performance. But obviously, Sam talked to other potential investors, and eventually, they picked Microsoft,” he said. Microsoft ultimately inked the deal, which made it the exclusive provider of computing power for OpenAI’s research, products, and programming interfaces for developers. However, Microsoft lost its status as OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider at the start of this year.And that relationship now appears to be on rocky footing. According to recent reports, Microsoft hasn’t approved an OpenAI restructuring plan that would turn it into a more conventional for-profit company.Touching upon the reports, Son suggested that Altman should have chosen SoftBank, not Microsoft, as its initial partner, though he noted that SoftBank was smaller at the time and that Microsoft had its global supply chains, technical talents and brand value to offer. SoftBank has previously stated that it could reduce its portion of its $30 billion investment in OpenAI’s latest funding round in March to $20 billion if it doesn’t restructure into a for-profit entity by Dec. 31.However, on Friday, Son said that his conviction on OpenAI has only grown stronger and that SoftBank will continue to deepen its relationship with the company, regardless of what happens with Microsoft. Artificial superintelligencePart of Son’s belief in OpenAI stems from his desire for SoftBank to be at the center of “artificial superintelligence,” which he has described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. Son said on Friday that he wants SoftBank to become the biggest platform provider for this ASI within the next decade, serving as the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era.” He added that SoftBank’s partnership with OpenAI, along with British semiconductor company Arm, which SoftBank acquired in 2016, would be essential to those plans.Other major AI-related investments that SoftBank has made this year include an acquisition of U.S.-based chips designer Ampere for $6.5 billion.

2025-06-27 02:11:34,"Confusion As Trump Says Deal With China ""Signed"" Yet Both Sides Violate Terms Of Ceasefire","Confusion As Trump Says Deal With China ""Signed"" Yet Both Sides Violate Terms Of Ceasefire There was a burst of confusion late in the day when Donald Trump said that the US and China had signed a trade deal two weeks after saying they had reached an understanding in London about how to implement a ceasefire in the countries’ dispute.“We just signed with China yesterday,” the president said at the White House on Thursday, without providing any details.Trump: We just signed with China yesterday pic.twitter.com/U1FreLcE46— Acyn (@Acyn) June 26, 2025The reality turned out to be far less exciting than what Trump represented.Shortly after, a White House official said the US and China had ""agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement"", in a reference to the trade talks that the nations held in May, when they first negotiated a truce, which was really just an agreement to continue negotiating. And since there was still leftover confusion, Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, said that the US and China sign a ""finalized a trade understanding"" reached last month in Geneva adding that the White House has imminent plans to reach agreements with a set of 10 major trading partners.The China deal, which Lutnick said had been signed two days ago, codified the terms laid out in trade talks between Beijing and Washington, including a commitment from China to deliver rare earths used in everything from wind turbines to jet planes. In other words, the ""deal"" that was just signed was merely another reaffirmation that the two sides continue to talk about eventually sitting down to negotiate. Lutnick told Bloomberg Television that President Donald Trump was also prepared to finalize a slate of trade deals in the coming two weeks in connection with the president’s July 9 deadline to reinstate higher tariffs he paused in April. “We’re going to do top 10 deals, put them in the right category, and then these other countries will fit behind,” he said. Lutnick did not specify which nations would be part of that first wave of trade pacts, though earlier Thursday Trump suggested the US was nearing an agreement with India. As a reminder, the ""China accord"" Lutnick described is far from a comprehensive trade deal that addresses thorny questions about fentanyl trafficking and American exporters’ access to Chinese markets. After an initial round of negotiations in Geneva resulted in a reduction in tariffs imposed by both countries, the US and China accused each other of violating their agreement. After subsequent talks in London this month, negotiators from the US and China announced they had arrived at an understanding, pending approval from Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Lutnick said that under the agreement inked two days ago, US “countermeasures” imposed ahead of the London talks would be lifted, but only once rare earth materials start flowing from China.Which is a problem: as discussed previously, China's biggest point of leverage in the trade war negotiations is its control of rare earth exports to the US; it's also why the ceasefire deal announced in early June was mostly meant to restart exports of Chinese rare earths to the US.That never happened. As the WSJ reported overnight, two weeks after China promised the U.S. it would ease the exports of rare-earth magnets, Chinese authorities have been dragging out approval of Western companies’ requests for the critical components, a situation that is bound to reignite trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.Western companies say they are receiving barely enough magnets for their factories and have little visibility of future supplies. Firms are waiting weeks as Chinese authorities scrutinize their applications, only to be rejected in some cases. And applications for raw rare earths, which are used to make magnets, are rarely granted.As a result, Western companies are concerned that the shortages could soon affect manufacturing. Companies are so desperate for magnets that they are opting for expensive airfreight whenever licenses are granted to prevent costly production shutdowns. Some manufacturers are experimenting with workarounds that would allow them to make their products without the most powerful magnets.“It’s hand to mouth—the normal supply-chain scrambling that you have to do,” said Lisa Drake, a vice president overseeing Ford’s industrial planning for batteries and electric vehicles, earlier this week. Although she said the situation had improved, the scarcity of the rare-earth magnets is forcing Ford to “move things around” to avoid factory shutdowns, she said.As a result, contrary to White House assertions that the flow of the critical components would return to normal, manufacturers have taken the continuing challenges as a sign that new Chinese rare-earth export restrictions, introduced in April after President Trump raised tariffs on China, are here to stay.“Yes, the export restrictions have been paused on paper. However, ground reality is completely different,” said Neha Mukherjee, a rare-earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The licensing process is plagued by “bureaucratic drag.”On Thursday, China’s Ministry of Commerce issued a token statement that it has been accelerating the review of rare-earth export license applications and has approved “a certain number.” The restrictions illustrate the power Beijing holds through its formidable supply chains and how it can use them to inflict pain on Western businesses and exact concessions from the US. China makes 90% of the world’s most powerful rare-earth magnets, a key component in everything from cars to jet fighters. In April, after Trump heaped stiff tariffs on Chinese products, Beijing established an export-control system for rare earths. While it said the license system was set up to regulate the export of materials for military use, the regime has in effect allowed China to clamp down on rare-earths supplies as it wishes.After April, the supply of magnets to Western businesses slowed to a trickle, causing shock waves for global car, defense and electronics makers. Exports of rare-earth magnets to the U.S. declined 93% in May from a year earlier. Ford stopped production of its Explorer SUV at its Chicago plant for a week in May.The U.S. accused China of slow-walking the approval of export licenses, which China denied. The shortage drove both sides back to the bargaining table earlier this month, where China agreed to free up the flow of rare earths in exchange for the U.S. easing its own restrictions on certain U.S. exports to China.Following the deal, Trump wrote that “full magnets, and any necessary rare earths, will be supplied up front by China.”However, China put only a six-month limit on any new licenses, we later learned as Beijing seeks to keep DC on a tight leash. Now, in the applications for export licenses, Chinese authorities are asking Western companies for sensitive details such as contact information of those buying their magnets and even designs of how their magnets are integrated into components like motors.Beijing also appears to be trying to prevent stockpiling by Western businesses. One Chinese magnet maker has warned clients seeking to import more magnets than usual that they may have to explain to government officials the “business drivers” behind such large orders, according to an advisory note the magnet maker shared with clients.Fearful of shortages, many Western businesses are complying with the information requests—but are still facing long delays. The success of their application also depends on their supplier. Big state-connected magnet companies are getting export licenses faster than smaller private ones, according to many in the industry.“The export policy for magnet[s] is still very strict,” said a representative for one Chinese magnet maker. Now, some Western businesses say they are resigned to the fact that the restrictions may remain in place indefinitely.For a detailed analysis of the leverage China has with its supply chain of Rare Earths, please read Morgan Stanley's key report on the topic ""How China Is Playing Its Rare Earth Card"" (available to pro subscribers).And while China is clearly dominating the rare earth supply chain (for now, as it is only a matter of time before the Trump admin subsidizes domestic producers such as MP Materials to ramp up production as an alternative to China), the US is doing the same with ethane (a relationship we described in ""China's Need For US Chemicals Greater Than US Need For Rare Earths"".)China imported more than 565,000 barrels per day of petrochemical feedstocks from the US in 2024 according to the Energy Information Administration, with a value of over $4.7 billion. That dwarfed the $170 million of rare earths the US imported last year, about 70% of which came from China, according to the US Geological Survey.The figures show the dependence the US and China have developed on each other by ever tightening trade links over the past few decades. While China has a tight grip on refining many metals crucial for industry, it also takes in niche chemicals from the US that are difficult to buy elsewhere.China leans on naphtha to produce most base chemicals, which are processed further to end up in everyday items like electronics and clothing. However, some plants can switch to cheaper propane when the economics make sense, which they do regularly. Propane dehydrogenation plants however can’t process alternatives like naphtha. The US accounted for over half of all China’s propane imports in 2024. And so, with China refusing to comply with the terms of the recent ceasefire and unlock rare earth exports to the US, Washington is doing the same, and as Reuters reported yesterday, the US sent letters to Enterprise Products and Energy Transfer on Wednesday informing the companies they could load ethane on vessels destined for China but could not unload the ethane in China without authorization. The letters from the U.S. Department of Commerce follow a licensing requirement imposed several weeks ago on the companies' exports of ethane to China, which halted shipments and led to vessels anchoring in or hovering around the US Gulf CoastA copy of the letter seen by Reuters and later released by Enterprise Products said, ""This letter authorizes Enterprise Products to load vessels with ethane, transport and anchor in foreign ports, even if... to a party located in China,"" the letter said. ""However, Enterprise Products may not complete such export... to a party that is located in China,"" without further authorization.The letters, Reuters muses, may signal the US preparing to lift restrictions imposed on exports to China in late May and early June, as the U.S.-China trade war shifted from retaliatory tariffs, to curbs on each others supply chains. With China granting rare earth export licenses to some firms and saying it would speed up the approval process, the U.S. now appears close to permitting ethane exports to China.However, the decision to limit unloading of ethane is more likely another form of negotiation, one which signals that the cargo will not be released unless China complies with its own terms, and resumes shipments of rare earths. About half of all US ethane exports go to China, where it is used by the petrochemical industry. China’s ethane cracking capacity is dwarfed by its capacity to process naphtha and propane, but almost all of its ethane imports come from the US. The restrictions will have a significant impact on the Lianyungang and Tianjin plants, owned by Satellite Chemical, Sinopec and INEOS. SP Chemicals, a Singapore-based producer, sources most of its feedstock from Enterprise Products Partners.The ability to load and begin transporting ethane could relieve congestion at ports along the U.S. Gulf coast, where vessels have been stalled, although that now appears to be dependent on China complying with the terms of the London ceasefire. Since May 23, the U.S. imposed new restrictions on exports to China of everything from ethane and chip design software to jet engines and nuclear plant parts.As the trade war continues, it appears commodities are now leading the confrontation, with players on both sides set to feel the pain.More in the Morgan Stanley report ""How China Is Playing Its Rare Earth Card"", available to pro subscribers.

2025-06-27 02:05:00,U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approves Streamlined Patient Monitoring Requirements and Removal of REMS Programs within Bristol Myers Squibb's Cell Therapy Labels,"Label updates reflect growing body of real-world evidence and regulatory confidence in the safety profile of the class of CD19- and BCMA-directed autologous CAR T cell therapies, reinforcing efforts to increase equitable accessOnly about 2 in 10 eligible patients currently receive cell therapy treatment; today's announcement will reduce unnecessary barriers for patients and providersBristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved label updates for both of its CAR T cell therapies, Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) for the treatment of large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) and other lymphomas and Abecma® (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel) for the treatment of multiple myeloma. These label updates reduce certain patient monitoring requirements and remove the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) programs that had been in place since each product was initially approved.Despite the transformative potential of cell therapy, only about 2 in 10 eligible patients receive it, due to the confluence of complex logistical and geographic barriers affecting patients and providers. BMS is committed to a long-term goal of expanding access to cell therapy and supports today's class-wide label updates that will help ease known barriers to treatment and administration while maintaining patient safety.Across both labels, the FDA has approved the reduction or removal of specific patient monitoring requirements for Breyanzi and Abecma. These prolonged requirements posed burdens on healthcare delivery systems and for certain patients and their care partners, particularly those who live far from certified cell therapy treatment centers. The changes include:Driving restrictions reduced from 8 weeks to 2 weeks post treatmentRequirement to stay within proximity of a healthcare facility following infusion reduced from 4 weeks to 2 weeks""CAR T cell therapy is a transformational, potentially life-saving option for patients living with blood cancers, and we are working to challenge current practices, assumptions and barriers that limit access,"" said Lynelle B. Hoch, president, Cell Therapy Organization, Bristol Myers Squibb. ""Today's FDA-approved label updates reinforce BMS' continued efforts to collaborate across the healthcare ecosystem, with the ultimate goal of reaching more patients and democratizing access to cell therapy.""The FDA has also approved removal of the REMS requirement from each product label. A REMS program is often required to help mitigate known or potential risks associated with new drugs or therapies. The FDA has since determined that the established management guidelines and extensive experience of the medical hematology/oncology community are sufficient to diagnose and manage the risks of side effects, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities (NTs), without a REMS for the class of CD19- and BCMA-directed autologous CAR T cell therapies. This change is likely to help further accelerate cell therapy into the community center setting.Together, these label updates reflect the growing body of clinical and real-world evidence underpinning the favorable efficacy and safety profile of CAR T cell therapy. To date, more than 30,000 patients have been treated with a CAR T cell therapy, with recent studies, including an analysis BMS presented earlier this month at the ASCO Annual Meeting, showing that the vast majority of serious adverse events (CRS and NTs) occur within the first two weeks of infusion.Following this announcement, BMS will work closely with the more than 150 treatment centers currently approved to administer Breyanzi and Abecma to remove the REMS programs. In parallel, BMS is focused on rapidly expanding the geographic footprint of cell therapy, with a renewed effort to add community cancer centers nationwide to administer Breyanzi and Abecma closer to patients, helping further reduce travel time and duration of stay away from home, family and work.""Living with blood cancer is challenging, but patients and their loved ones still need to maintain jobs, take care of families, and plan for the future,"" said Sally Werner, chief executive officer, Cancer Support Community. ""Today's announcement reduces some of the most onerous requirements that may have previously discouraged patients, particularly those who live far from a treatment center, from seeking the potentially transformational effects of cell therapy. We applaud any and all efforts to continue to break down barriers, reduce time burden on patients and caregivers, and increase uptake of this life-saving therapy.""As BMS continues to bring cell therapy to more patients, we are committed to working across the healthcare ecosystem to implement these label updates and continue to design and implement measurable programs to increase uptake and equitable access to cell therapy.

Thune will keep trying, but that eats up time and draws out GOP critics.The Senate needs to decide on Medicaid, both in terms of how much to cut and how to do it. A growing number of senators are expressing a preference for going back to the House's freeze on provider taxes.The House SALT caucus is savaging the Senate's offerings on a deal. Between the lines: House Speaker Mike Johnson opened the door Thursday to going to conference and changing the Senate-passed version instead of an up-or-down vote.""If there are major modifications that we can't accept, then we would go back to the drawing board, fix some of that and send it back over,"" he told reporters.Earlier this week, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) told CNN: ""When it comes over, we'll pass it.""Zoom out: Trump is reengaging with Congress on what the final version of his ""big, beautiful bill"" should look like.He hosted lawmakers, including Johnson, at the White House on Thursday at an event designed to build political pressure to pass a bill.Trump called Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) Wednesday night and ripped the Senate plan for Medicaid provider taxes, saying the House plan was better, according to a person familiar with the matter.On the so-called ""revenge tax,"" which was included in the House version, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent demanded that the Senate remove the provision, which had caused consternation among investors and foreign subsidiaries operating in the U.S.The bottom line: ""He just wants us to get a bill on his desk,"" Thune told reporters tonight after meeting Trump at the White House.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/27/thune-big-beautiful-bill-trump-senate-house,politics,

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a pair of prominent liberals who also criticized Trump for attacking Iran.The ad also targets Massie for voting against Trump-backed legislation aimed at cutting taxes and funding border security.""Let's fire Thomas Massie,"" the ad says.Representatives for Massie did not respond to requests for comment.The background: MAGA Kentucky is affiliated with Trump's official political apparatus.It is led by senior Trump advisers Chris LaCivita and Tony Fabrizio.Trump advisers are actively recruiting a primary challenger to Massie, with an eye toward clearing the field so Massie rivals don't splinter support.""The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary, and I'll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.The other side: Massie allies argue that his libertarian streak has made him politically popular in his conservative central Kentucky district.He easily fended off primary challenges the last three election cycles.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/26/trump-thomas-massie-maga-kentucky,politics,

2025-06-28 11:35:00,Kremlin Reacts To NATO Defense Spending Hike: 'No Significant Effect',"Kremlin Reacts To NATO Defense Spending Hike: 'No Significant Effect' The Kremlin in a new Friday statement made clear that NATO's decision to significantly boost military spending, formalized this week at the annual NATO summit in The Hague, which Trump and other leaders attended, won’t have a meaningful impact on Russia’s security.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov responded to a reporter's question over what impact NATO's commitment to 5% of GDP on defense over the next decade for each member state will be by saying, ""I don’t think it will have any significant effect.""""We know what goals we are pursuing; we don’t hide them, we state them openly, and they are absolutely legitimate in terms of any interpretation of the UN Charter and international law. We know by what means we will always ensure these goals,"" he said.NATO has cited the necessity of a drastic increase in spending, which notably Spain has resisted, as necessary based on the ""long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security.""Throughout over three-years of the grinding Ukraine war, Western officials have consistently sounded the alarm over an 'expansionist' Russia; however, it has become clear that the Kremlin does no even want to occupy Kiev or Western Ukraine - and that the top goal is solidifying hold over Russian-speaking territories of the east.In response to this NATO assumption that Putin could breach the 'eastern flank' and amid expansionist aims, Russia's RT has the following:Moscow has repeatedly said it has no intention of attacking any NATO member states, dismissing such claims as “nonsense” and attributing them to Western officials’ attempts to justify increased military spending. Meanwhile, this week the European Union planned to push forward and approve it's 18th package of anti-Moscow sanctions, but this has been postponed due to resistance from Hungary and Slovakia.Also, President Trump has voiced his view that yet more fresh sanctions would likely not have any immediate effect and that the action would be detrimental to peace efforts.The question of US-backed efforts to get the two warring sides to the negotiating table is very much an open one currently. Both have become even more entrenched in their unwillingness to compromise, with Zelensky having said he won't even give up Crimea. There is not even a date for a potential next round of Istanbul talks.

2025-06-28 11:00:00,The End Of Bank Branches: How Europe's Digital Euro And Stablecoins Are Reshaping Finance,"The End Of Bank Branches: How Europe's Digital Euro And Stablecoins Are Reshaping Finance Submitted by Thomas KolbeThe digital age is dawning. Repetitive tasks are being automated, and technologies like artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles are reshaping our daily lives—just as the financial sector is undergoing a profound digital transformation. The slow disappearance of physical bank branches is one of the clearest signs of this upheaval.The desertion of Germany’s town centers is a symptom of this new era. High rents, shrinking consumer power, and demographic decline—especially in rural areas—collide with the shockwaves of e-commerce and a rapidly digitalizing economy. More and more of our consumer habits are migrating online, and the banking industry, long anchored by its brick-and-mortar branches, is no exception.A Long-Term TrendThe quiet death of Germany’s bank branch networks has been underway for years—a global phenomenon driven by customers embracing online banking, decentralized access to investment portfolios, and other digital financial services. The latest data presented by Barkow Consulting on behalf of the European Central Bank (ECB) confirms this trend: in 2023 alone, German banks closed approximately 560 branches, a 2.8 percent reduction.That may sound like a moderate consolidation—but in context, it’s part of a decades-long structural shift. Ten years ago, German banks operated more than 35,000 branches. A quarter-century ago, that number was closer to 60,000. Today, only 18,933 remain.Deutsche Bank Leads the WayIn March, industry giant Deutsche Bank announced major job cuts during its annual press conference, citing the need to boost cost efficiency in light of ongoing sectoral changes. “We are witnessing a fundamental transformation in the German banking sector,” stated Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing. His institution alone plans to eliminate roughly 2,000 jobs and close a “significant number” of branches this year.Customer consultations, he explained, will increasingly take place via video and phone. This marks not only a cost-saving shift but also a paradigm change that threatens to erode the personal trust traditionally built in face-to-face banking relationships. The business becomes leaner and more efficient—but less personal, and perhaps less trustworthy.Multifaceted PressuresCommercial banks have for years operated in a complex web of pressures: technological change, the digitization of transaction processes, the rise of online banking, and above all, monetary policy. Margin pressure has forced cost-cutting across the board. One key reason for the shrinking sector is the ECB’s ultra-loose monetary policy. More than a decade of zero and negative interest rates has destroyed the traditional banking model of earning profits through interest spreads.Savings banks, credit unions, and even large private banks found themselves unable to operate profitably under artificially distorted yield curves. Deposits no longer generated returns, while regulatory costs and penalty interest increased. The ECB's monetary policy not only eroded customer savings but also deprived the banking sector of its essential function. The closure of branches, layoffs, and digital pivots are direct consequences of a policy that primarily served one goal: stabilizing the over-indebted public finances of much of the Eurozone.Countries like Spain, Italy, and France, with debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 120 percent, can no longer service their debts at market interest rates. The ECB’s continued intervention—through rate suppression and asset purchases—buys these governments time but shifts the burden onto private banks and savers.Digital Euro and StablecoinsNow, the next tidal wave is approaching. The rise of “stablecoins”—digital currencies pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar—heralds the next level of direct banking. Stablecoins offer fast, low-cost, round-the-clock global transactions without intermediaries like traditional banks.As decentralized finance (DeFi) grows, traditional banks are losing their roles as payment processors and credit intermediaries. The more people embrace digital wallets and smart contracts, the less need there is for checking accounts, physical branches, or personal banking advice. Stablecoins accelerate the disconnection from traditional banking—a creeping loss of control for institutions built on an analog infrastructure ill-suited for the digital era.The coup de grâce for bank branches may come with the introduction of the digital euro. This programmable currency, developed by the ECB on a blockchain platform, would likely turbocharge the adoption of digital wallets and decentralized financial services. The detour through commercial banks would become obsolete.As the banking sector loses its role as intermediary, especially small-scale retail clients will be the first to switch from traditional checking accounts to central bank-backed alternatives. Branches—once pillars of customer loyalty and cash access—will become redundant. The digital euro acts as an accelerant for the already fragile infrastructure of retail banking.We’ll have to get used to it: the local bank branch, once a staple of every high street, may soon be a relic of the past.* * * Thomas Kolbe, born in 1978 in Neuss/ Germany, is a graduate economist.

But in the short term, at least on paper, it appears the Bruins did pretty well over the last two days in Los Angeles.The Bruins very much needed to bolster their talent and depth at center in this draft, so it wasn’t surprising to see them select centers with their first two picks.The B’s were fortunate that Boston College star James Hagens — the No. 1 ranked prospect in the 2025 class before the season — fell to them at No. 7. He tallied 37 points (11 goals, 26 assists) in 37 games for the Eagles last season and projects to be a top-six center at the NHL level.Boston selected another center — William Moore — with the No. 51 overall pick in Round 2. Some experts had Moore ranked as a top-35 prospect in this class, so the Bruins getting him at No. 51 was pretty good value.More Bruins coverageNick Goss8 hours agoNHL Draft recap: Bruins make six picks, two trades on busy Day 2Nick Goss7 hours agoWhen could Bruins first-round draft pick James Hagens play in NHL?Nick Goss19 hours agoJames Hagens falling to No. 7 was best-case scenario for Bruins in NHL DraftThe Bruins’ other second-round pick was Swedish defenseman Liam Pettersson at No. 61 overall. He is a good offensive player and moves the puck well, but he has plenty of room for improvement defensively.The Bruins’ third-round pick was left wing Cooper Simpson, whose 49 goals in 31 games led all Minnesota high school players last season. He has committed to the University of North Dakota. Boston added another d-man in Vashek Blanar with the No. 100 overall pick in the fourth round. He has tremendous size at 6-foot-4 and 183 pounds. The B’s took another center in the fifth round with the selection of Cole Chandler at No. 133 overall. Chandler tallied 32 points (13 goals, 19 assists) in 64 games for the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL last season.The Bruins’ final pick at No. 165 overall in the sixth round was Russian center Kirill Yemelyanov, bringing the total number of centers drafted by Boston to four.The Bruins made at least one pick in each of the first three rounds of the draft. The last time they did that was 2015. With seven players taken, this draft class is the Bruins’ largest since 2021 (also seven players).Bruins general manager Don Sweeney also made two trades Saturday. He dealt the No. 69 pick to the Montreal Canadiens for the No. 79 and No. 108 picks. He then traded the No. 108 pick to the Tampa Bay Lightning for a 2026 fourth-rounder.

They didn’t share what led them to arrest Galloway, but noted in a statement “that no child was victimized as part of this specific incident.”It wasn’t immediately clear if Galloway had an attorney.“Fall River Public Schools was recently made aware that an employee had been arrested on serious charges involving alleged conduct occurring outside of school hours and off school property,” Curley said in her statement to the community Saturday.There were no indication the conduct was connected with the district, according to Curley, who said the district no longer employed or was affiliated with the person.“We are deeply troubled by these allegations and understand the impact this may have on our school community. Counseling and support services are available to any student or staff member who may need them, and we encourage anyone in need to contact the school principal or their direct supervisor,” Curley said in the statement.“The safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority.

2025-06-28 11:00:00,Old bogeymen reunite MAGA after explosive Iran divide,"A MAGA movement facing a historic rift over President Trump's Iran strikes is quickly stitching itself back together by turning its rage toward familiar enemies at home.Why it matters: Trump's decision to strike three Iranian nuclear facilities last week — paired with fleeting talk of ""regime change"" — ignited some of the fiercest infighting within the ""America First"" base since the movement's inception a decade ago.After Trump touted the success of the U.S. operation, some MAGA figures called for retribution against those who had criticized him — whether for not going far enough or for launching the strikes at all.By mid-week, the divisions were fading.Driving the news: A cascade of political flashpoints — each touching a MAGA ""third rail"" — quickly redirected the movement's fury away from its Iran fissures and toward longtime enemies.Media coverage of a leaked Pentagon assessment, which suggested the U.S. strikes only delayed Iran's nuclear program by only a few, triggered new MAGA attacks on the press for undermining Trump.Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the primary for New York City mayor gave MAGA influencers a potent new foil: a Muslim, immigrant, left-wing candidate who they claim embodies the dangers of multiculturalism.Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough became a lightning rod after ruling that key GOP priorities had to be stripped from Trump's ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" — feeding MAGA's long-running resentment of ""unelected bureaucrats.""The Supreme Court issued three rulings that exhilarated MAGA: one clearing the way for states to strip funding for Planned Parenthood, a second allowing parents to opt their children out of LGBTQ-themed lessons at school, and a third limiting lower courts' ability to block Trump's policies nationwide.The bottom line: The deep ideological fault lines over Iran remain unresolved, and could rear their head if tensions in the Middle East force Trump to again consider military intervention.But for now, a perfect blend of red meat is helping to distract, unify and re-energize a base that had briefly turned on itself.""Who gives a damn about Iran when a socialist sycophant is poised to take power and burn America's largest city to the ground?"" said MAGA influencer CJ Pearson.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/28/trump-maga-iran-divide,politics,

2025-06-28 11:00:00,Bridging the LGBTQ+ wealth gap,"In many ways, the world is a much friendlier place for members of the LGBTQ+ community on this, the 56th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, than it was a lifetime ago.But that doesn’t make navigating American life while queer any less frightening. In addition to the federal government making overt attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, many of the same invisible barriers that kept the LGBTQ+ community impoverished a lifetime ago are still at work today.Financial marginalization may seem like small potatoes compared to fighting for the right to exist, but the unacknowledged systems keeping the LGTBQ+ wealth gap in place are the same systems working to erase queer history.Illuminating these hidden financial systems is the first step toward bridging the wealth gap.The problem: family estrangementGay and lesbian young adults are 86% more likely to report estrangement from their fathers than their straight counterparts, according to a 2022 National Institute of Health study, and a recent U.K. survey found that 46% of LGBTQ respondents between the ages of 18 and 25 are estranged from at least one family member.Estrangement is painful enough, but it can also put queer kids at serious financial risk. LGBTQ+ youth have a 120% higher risk of experiencing homelessness compared to the general population.But even if coming out doesn’t completely sever the familial relationship, it can change family dynamics, including financial expectations. In the 2023 LGBTQI+ Economic and Financial (LEAF) Survey, 38% of those surveyed said they lost the option of relying financially on their families after coming out. This leads to things like a significantly higher likelihood of carrying student debt into adulthood and more than double the rate of bank overdrafts compared to the general population.The early loss of direct financial assistance may be the most obvious obstacle to LGBTQ+ wealth building, but Dr. Jenna Brownfield, a queer Licensed Psychologist based in Minnesota, suggests looking at the less clear-cut financial barriers that come with estrangement.“It’s more than just passing down wealth,” Dr. Brownfield says. “It’s also the knowledge of how to navigate finances. If you don’t have a relationship with an older family member to demystify and guide you through things like insurance and taxes, you’re left to learn that on your own.”Unlike learning how to change a tire, roast a chicken, or apply a perfect smoky eye-shadow effect, it can be more difficult to find reputable and trustworthy financial information on YouTube or TikTok—and the lack of this knowledge really hurts anyone who falls afoul of Lady Luck or Uncle Sam.The work-around: chosen familyParents have been cutting off their LGBTQ+ kids from time immemorial, and the queer community has responded by creating a culture of chosen family. Leaning into the cultural legacy of multigenerational queer friendship and found family is an excellent way to help bridge the financial knowledge gap.Though discussing money is typically a taboo topic for discussion, openly sharing hard-won money skills with the younger generation is an excellent way to fight back against marginalization.The problem: lack of access to healthcareApproximately 17% of LGBTQ+ adults do not have any health insurance, which is a major improvement over the 34% of queer adults who were uninsured in 2013, just before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But having insurance doesn’t necessarily equate to receiving care.A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that LGBTQ+ adults faced higher rates of discrimination and unfair treatment at the doctor’s office compared to non-LGBTQ adults. Queer adults were also more likely to report going without needed mental health care because of affordability or accessibility.But even finding a caring doctor in network doesn’t guarantee affordable healthcare, especially for transgender individuals: 82% of LEAF survey respondents who received gender-affirming care reported spending some money out of pocket. Nearly half (46%) of those respondents spent $5,000 or more, while 33% spent at least $10,000 of their own money.But whether it’s paying out of pocket for affirming care or avoiding the doctor because of cost (or bad experiences) until the only choice is the emergency room, cutting the LGBTQ+ community out of healthcare becomes another invisible financial drain.The work-around: medical allyshipThe American system of health insurance doesn’t really work for anyone, but it seems to make a special effort to work especially badly for marginalized groups like the LGBTQ+ community. While there is very little that cishet friends of queer folks can do about the obscenely high insurance copays and deductibles, a friend can potentially ride along to doctor’s visits.There are two good reasons for roping a friend into a doctor’s appointment. First, since LGBTQ+ folks are more likely to face discrimination and unfair treatment in healthcare settings compared to straight patients, the presence of a friendly ally may mitigate any awful behavior on the part of the medical team.Second, making doctor visits an outing with a friend increases the likelihood of actually going and getting necessary preventive care. That will lead to better health and financial outcomes.Dr. Brownfield has also seen other ways that cishet allies have stepped up to help with the high cost of LGBTQ+ healthcare.“Prescription hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to help with perimenopausal symptoms would be covered differently by my insurance than they would for a trans woman getting the same exact prescription,” she says. “As legislation changes, I’m seeing work-arounds where cis women or cis men are securing an HRT prescription and providing it to their trans loved ones or trans folks in their community.”Unfortunately, this kind of workaround means the patient doesn’t have a medical professional to collaborate with for proper dosage. Dr. Brownfield emphasizes that prescription swapping is the direct and hazardous result of legislating care. “When gender-affirming care becomes illegal, its use doesn’t go down–but its safe use does,” she says.The problem: mortgage discriminationAs of 2019, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that same-sex couples were 73% more likely to be denied a mortgage than heterosexual couples.There has not been a follow up to this study in the past six years, but homeownership among the LGBTQ+ community remains lower than it is among straight, cisgender adults: 49% of queer adults own a home, compared to 64% of the U.S. population as a whole.Getting shut out of home ownership is a great way to cut LGBTQ+ wealth building off at the knees. A primary residence is a typical U.S. homeowner’s most valuable asset, accounting for about 45% of their household net worth, on average.The work-around: shared housing“Informal shared housing is something that’s happened in the queer community for decades,” Dr. Brownfield says. “Especially for youth and young adults. There’s often like a house mother and everyone shares resources and responsibilities, but it’s all done informally.”While this kind of setup probably won’t land a sweet, low-cost mortgage loan—it’s unlikely the shared housing is anything other than a rental—it can be an inexpensive way to live with friends while saving money toward home ownership or other goals.Making the invisible visibleNeither the financial obstacles facing the LGBTQ+ community nor the creative work-arounds to overcome those barriers are news to queer folks. But for those of us who might put away our allyship when retailers set out the next seasonal display, it’s important to remember that systemic issues occur year-round, and not just while the rainbow flags are flying.",fastcompany,https://www.fastcompany.com/91358698/bridging-the-lgbtq-wealth-gap?partner=rss,politics,

2025-06-28 09:49:57,Oreo is bringing back a fan-favorite flavor after 8 years: ‘Stop yelling at us',"It will take a few years before we can accurately judge the quality of the Boston Bruins’ 2025 draft class. But in the short term, at least on paper, it appears the Bruins did pretty well over the last two days in Los Angeles.The Bruins very much needed to bolster their talent and depth at center in this draft, so it wasn’t surprising to see them select centers with their first two picks.The B’s were fortunate that Boston College star James Hagens — the No. 1 ranked prospect in the 2025 class before the season — fell to them at No. 7. He tallied 37 points (11 goals, 26 assists) in 37 games for the Eagles last season and projects to be a top-six center at the NHL level.Boston selected another center — William Moore — with the No. 51 overall pick in Round 2. Some experts had Moore ranked as a top-35 prospect in this class, so the Bruins getting him at No. 51 was pretty good value.More Bruins coverageNick Goss8 hours agoNHL Draft recap: Bruins make six picks, two trades on busy Day 2Nick Goss7 hours agoWhen could Bruins first-round draft pick James Hagens play in NHL?Nick Goss19 hours agoJames Hagens falling to No. 7 was best-case scenario for Bruins in NHL DraftThe Bruins’ other second-round pick was Swedish defenseman Liam Pettersson at No. 61 overall. He is a good offensive player and moves the puck well, but he has plenty of room for improvement defensively.The Bruins’ third-round pick was left wing Cooper Simpson, whose 49 goals in 31 games led all Minnesota high school players last season. He has committed to the University of North Dakota. Boston added another d-man in Vashek Blanar with the No. 100 overall pick in the fourth round. He has tremendous size at 6-foot-4 and 183 pounds. The B’s took another center in the fifth round with the selection of Cole Chandler at No. 133 overall. Chandler tallied 32 points (13 goals, 19 assists) in 64 games for the Shawinigan Cataractes of the QMJHL last season.The Bruins’ final pick at No. 165 overall in the sixth round was Russian center Kirill Yemelyanov, bringing the total number of centers drafted by Boston to four.The Bruins made at least one pick in each of the first three rounds of the draft. The last time they did that was 2015. With seven players taken, this draft class is the Bruins’ largest since 2021 (also seven players).Bruins general manager Don Sweeney also made two trades Saturday. He dealt the No. 69 pick to the Montreal Canadiens for the No. 79 and No. 108 picks. He then traded the No. 108 pick to the Tampa Bay Lightning for a 2026 fourth-rounder.

2025-06-29 10:55:49,"An Energy Star inside U.S. homes is under attack from Trump, with the cost to homeowners uncertain","China has shown its readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence on rate earth metals. A new trade framework announced under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months does not change the fact that critical mineral supply chains are too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Beijing’s leverage and control. It is time for the United States to treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power, writes international policy and trade analyst Dewardric McNeal.In April 2025, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and the permanent magnets derived from them — materials that form the foundation of modern life and modern warfare. Fighter jets, missiles, electric vehicles, drones, wind turbines, and even data centers rely on high-performance magnets made from these critical minerals. By restricting their flow, Beijing did not just flex its industrial muscle, it revealed America’s and the rest of the world’s dangerous vulnerability. China’s latest actions show their readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence.This is not a new challenge. The United States has known for over 15 years that its critical mineral supply chains were too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Chinese leverage and control. And yet, across Democratic and Republican administrations, we have failed to respond with urgency or coherence. Now, the consequences of those failures have grabbed us by the neck and are cascading across our commercial and defense sectors.Following the London talks, Washington and Beijing announced on Friday a new trade framework under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months. U.S. officials have publicly extolled the breakthrough — but have offered few details about what was given in return. That leaves major questions unanswered: What were the U.S. trade-offs? How will the deal be enforced? And what happens when the six months are up?Skepticism is high. Ford recently halted production at its Chicago plant due to a magnet shortage — underscoring that even short-term supply interruptions have real consequences. Paper agreements are not supply chain solutions. Without transparency, timely approvals, and long-term planning, this could easily become another diplomatic cycle of one step forward, two steps back.Even this limited reprieve carries risks. Dozens of companies in Europe and North America have described China’s export license process as highly invasive — requiring firms to submit detailed production data, end-use applications, facility images, customer names, and transaction histories. Some applicants have been denied for not providing photographs or documentation of their end users.Executives say the process amounts to “official information extraction.”While firms are advised not to share sensitive IP, omitting key details can mean indefinite delays. For companies in defense supply chains, the implications are alarming: valuable commercial intelligence could be used to map competitors, disrupt pricing, or advance Chinese substitutes.This isn’t just licensing — it’s competitive surveillance. And until the U.S. builds secure, independent capacity across the critical minerals supply chain, it remains exposed to both disruption and data risk.This vulnerability did not happen overnight. Many have been watching this slow-motion train wreck for years. In 2010, China cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute, a clear warning shot the U.S. observed but brushed off. In 2014, the Obama administration won a WTO case against China’s export restrictions but wrongly assumed that legal success would deter further manipulation.What Trump, Biden have doneThe first Trump administration identified rare earths as critical but notably exempted them from 2018 China tariffs, perhaps an unspoken acknowledgment of U.S. dependence. Biden took the most structured approach to date: Executive Order 14017, the Critical Minerals Working Group, and funding from the IIJA and IRA. Strategic partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership emerged. But progress was slow, hampered by permitting delays and uneven ally commitments.The second Trump administration has returned with more aggressive measures, invoking Section 232, activating the Defense Production Act, and proposing major funding boosts in FY2026. A National Energy Dominance Council now coordinates efforts. Yet these measures, like China’s six-month reprieve, still fall short of dislodging Beijing’s grip. And crucially, the defense sector remains cut off, with no such licensing window available.The recent G7 summit in Canada underscored the global stakes. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen directly accused China of “weaponizing” its control over key materials like rare earths, calling for a united G7 response. The result: a G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan. Though China was not mentioned by name, the subtext was unmistakable. The plan commits G7 members to raise ESG and traceability standards for key resources; mobilize capital for new projects in critical mineral mining and processing; and cooperate on innovation in recycling, substitution, and refining technologies.Predictably, Beijing reacted with fury. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the plan as “a pretext” for protectionism, claiming the G7 was instigating confrontation out of fear of losing market share.Brussels is now signaling that trade negotiations with Beijing are effectively stalled, so the odds of Chinese retaliation — particularly against the EU — are rising. If China doubles down, it risks pushing the EU, Japan, South Korea, and India more tightly into Washington’s orbit — precisely what Beijing hopes to avoid.China’s dominant position in rare earth miningThe raw numbers are staggering. China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare earth mining but over 90% of refining capacity. It produces 92% of the world’s neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets — used in everything from submarines to Teslas. This dominance is no accident. China subsidized processing, focused on global acquisitions across the supply chain, and scales up production much faster than the West can approve and issue permits for a single mine.U.S. sites like MP Materials‘ Mountain Pass and Round Top remain incomplete without downstream processing. The DoD and DOE have offered grants, and the FY2026 Trump budget looks to expand U.S. mining capacity and secure access to critical minerals. But all this remains dwarfed by China’s head start and longtime industrial command-and-control of the sector.George Rose | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine & Processing Facility, owned by MP Materials, in Mountain Pass, California. China moved early and decisively into Africa and Latin America, partnering with governments in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia, and Chile; investing in ports, rails, and refining infrastructure. In contrast, U.S. efforts and engagement on these sets of issues has been piecemeal and values-forward, prioritizing transparency and governance, important issues indeed, but delivering limited momentum of the critical mineral issues. Even recent MOUs with Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo remain, for now, symbolic, hindered by conflict and instability in those countries.The London talks and recent trade deal progress bought time. But time without a strategy is not fruitful. China’s licensing regime remains intact, its data demands unabated. The defense sector remains shut out. Meanwhile, congressional threats to rescind clean energy and industrial policy funding could stall rare-earth projects just as they gain traction.This is a decisive moment. China is betting that America’s internal divisions — between labor, industry, environmentalists, tribal nations, and political factions — will prevent the kind of unified, sustained effort needed to compete. They may be right. The U.S. needs to proves them wrong.Critical minerals are geopolitical powerThe United States must now treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power. China already does. Escaping its grip will require more than mine permits and short-term funding. It demands a coherent, long-term strategy to build a complete supply chain that includes not only domestic capabilities but also reliable allies and partners. From mining and refining to magnet production and recycling, every link must be strengthened through targeted investment, permitting reform, and strategic coordination.A successful and sustainable policy requires commitment from one presidency to the next. Nor can the U.S. afford to engage allies and partners only rhetorically. Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, and Indonesia (among others) need sustained partnerships backed by financing, technology transfer, and critical infrastructure investments, not just our lectures on governance.The six-month export reprieve from China is not a solution — it is a stress test. It reveals whether the U.S. can finally focus and act, or whether it will retreat again into complacency. Beijing is betting it will be the latter. Washington must respond with urgency, unity, and a strategy equal to the scale of the challenge.

2025-06-29 10:35:21,Sen. Thom Tillis says he won't seek re-election after opposing Trump megabill,"“It’s not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election,” Sen. Thom Tillis announced. His announcement comes after he voted against advancing President Donald Trump’s megabill. Trump has repeatedly criticized Tillis over his opposition to the sweeping tax package — and has threatened to explore primary challengers to the two-term senator. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, N.C., will not run for re-election when his term is up, he announced Sunday, hours after he voted against advancing President Donald Trump’s tax bill and drew the president’s ire.“As many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven’t exactly been excited about running for another term,” Tillis said in a statement.“That is true since the choice is between spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with the love of my life Susan, our two children, three beautiful grandchildren, and the rest of our extended family back home,” he said.“It’s not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election,” he continued.Tillis’ announcement is likely to spur a competitive — and costly — election in the North Carolina, where Trump had already said he would explore supporting a primary challenger to the two-term senator.

Tillis’ seat, which he has held since 2014, has also been a target for Democrats in next year’s midterms eager for a pick-up opportunity. This is breaking news.

About half of those sales occurred during the last month as the market notched new highs and shook off geopolitical tensions. Last week, the chipmaking giant hit a fresh record and rallied for five straight days following stock sales by CEO Jensen Huang and Nvidia’s annual shareholder meeting.Insiders at artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia have dumped more than $1 billion in stock over the last year, according to a report from the Financial Times.About $500 million worth of sales occurred over the last month as the market notched new highs and shook off geopolitical tensions that had rattled investors, according to the report. The stock is up more than 17% this year despite concerns over curbs limiting AI chip sales overseas and 44% over the last three months.Securities filings revealed that the tech titan recently unloaded about $15 million worth of shares as part of his more than $900 million plan announced in March to sell up to 6 million shares through the end of the year. Huang’s net worth totals about $138 billion, placing him as 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Last week, the chipmaking giant hit a fresh record and rallied for five straight days following the stock sales and an annual shareholder meeting, where the CEO called robotics the biggest opportunity for the company after AI. That helped the chipmaker regain its seat as the most valuable company ahead Microsoft and Apple.The FT article cited a report from VerityData, which noted that the jump in shares above $150 prompted the stock dump.Last year, Huang unloaded more than $700 million in Nvidia shares as part of a prearranged plan.Nvidia did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.Read the complete Financial Times report here.",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/nvidia-insiders-dump-more-than-1-billion-in-stock-according-to-report/3858362/,business,

2025-06-29 10:12:58,Op-ed: It's time for U.S. to treat rare earth metals as instruments of geopolitical power. China already does,"China has shown its readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence on rate earth metals. A new trade framework announced under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months does not change the fact that critical mineral supply chains are too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Beijing’s leverage and control. It is time for the United States to treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power, writes international policy and trade analyst Dewardric McNeal.In April 2025, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and the permanent magnets derived from them — materials that form the foundation of modern life and modern warfare. Fighter jets, missiles, electric vehicles, drones, wind turbines, and even data centers rely on high-performance magnets made from these critical minerals. By restricting their flow, Beijing did not just flex its industrial muscle, it revealed America’s and the rest of the world’s dangerous vulnerability. China’s latest actions show their readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence.This is not a new challenge. The United States has known for over 15 years that its critical mineral supply chains were too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Chinese leverage and control. And yet, across Democratic and Republican administrations, we have failed to respond with urgency or coherence. Now, the consequences of those failures have grabbed us by the neck and are cascading across our commercial and defense sectors.Following the London talks, Washington and Beijing announced on Friday a new trade framework under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months. U.S. officials have publicly extolled the breakthrough — but have offered few details about what was given in return. That leaves major questions unanswered: What were the U.S. trade-offs? How will the deal be enforced? And what happens when the six months are up?Skepticism is high. Ford recently halted production at its Chicago plant due to a magnet shortage — underscoring that even short-term supply interruptions have real consequences. Paper agreements are not supply chain solutions. Without transparency, timely approvals, and long-term planning, this could easily become another diplomatic cycle of one step forward, two steps back.Even this limited reprieve carries risks. Dozens of companies in Europe and North America have described China’s export license process as highly invasive — requiring firms to submit detailed production data, end-use applications, facility images, customer names, and transaction histories. Some applicants have been denied for not providing photographs or documentation of their end users.Executives say the process amounts to “official information extraction.”While firms are advised not to share sensitive IP, omitting key details can mean indefinite delays. For companies in defense supply chains, the implications are alarming: valuable commercial intelligence could be used to map competitors, disrupt pricing, or advance Chinese substitutes.This isn’t just licensing — it’s competitive surveillance. And until the U.S. builds secure, independent capacity across the critical minerals supply chain, it remains exposed to both disruption and data risk.This vulnerability did not happen overnight. Many have been watching this slow-motion train wreck for years. In 2010, China cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute, a clear warning shot the U.S. observed but brushed off. In 2014, the Obama administration won a WTO case against China’s export restrictions but wrongly assumed that legal success would deter further manipulation.What Trump, Biden have doneThe first Trump administration identified rare earths as critical but notably exempted them from 2018 China tariffs, perhaps an unspoken acknowledgment of U.S. dependence. Biden took the most structured approach to date: Executive Order 14017, the Critical Minerals Working Group, and funding from the IIJA and IRA. Strategic partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership emerged. But progress was slow, hampered by permitting delays and uneven ally commitments.The second Trump administration has returned with more aggressive measures, invoking Section 232, activating the Defense Production Act, and proposing major funding boosts in FY2026. A National Energy Dominance Council now coordinates efforts. Yet these measures, like China’s six-month reprieve, still fall short of dislodging Beijing’s grip. And crucially, the defense sector remains cut off, with no such licensing window available.The recent G7 summit in Canada underscored the global stakes. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen directly accused China of “weaponizing” its control over key materials like rare earths, calling for a united G7 response. The result: a G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan. Though China was not mentioned by name, the subtext was unmistakable. The plan commits G7 members to raise ESG and traceability standards for key resources; mobilize capital for new projects in critical mineral mining and processing; and cooperate on innovation in recycling, substitution, and refining technologies.Predictably, Beijing reacted with fury. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the plan as “a pretext” for protectionism, claiming the G7 was instigating confrontation out of fear of losing market share.Brussels is now signaling that trade negotiations with Beijing are effectively stalled, so the odds of Chinese retaliation — particularly against the EU — are rising. If China doubles down, it risks pushing the EU, Japan, South Korea, and India more tightly into Washington’s orbit — precisely what Beijing hopes to avoid.China’s dominant position in rare earth miningThe raw numbers are staggering. China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare earth mining but over 90% of refining capacity. It produces 92% of the world’s neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets — used in everything from submarines to Teslas. This dominance is no accident. China subsidized processing, focused on global acquisitions across the supply chain, and scales up production much faster than the West can approve and issue permits for a single mine.U.S. sites like MP Materials‘ Mountain Pass and Round Top remain incomplete without downstream processing. The DoD and DOE have offered grants, and the FY2026 Trump budget looks to expand U.S. mining capacity and secure access to critical minerals. But all this remains dwarfed by China’s head start and longtime industrial command-and-control of the sector.George Rose | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine & Processing Facility, owned by MP Materials, in Mountain Pass, California. China moved early and decisively into Africa and Latin America, partnering with governments in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia, and Chile; investing in ports, rails, and refining infrastructure. In contrast, U.S. efforts and engagement on these sets of issues has been piecemeal and values-forward, prioritizing transparency and governance, important issues indeed, but delivering limited momentum of the critical mineral issues. Even recent MOUs with Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo remain, for now, symbolic, hindered by conflict and instability in those countries.The London talks and recent trade deal progress bought time. But time without a strategy is not fruitful. China’s licensing regime remains intact, its data demands unabated. The defense sector remains shut out. Meanwhile, congressional threats to rescind clean energy and industrial policy funding could stall rare-earth projects just as they gain traction.This is a decisive moment. China is betting that America’s internal divisions — between labor, industry, environmentalists, tribal nations, and political factions — will prevent the kind of unified, sustained effort needed to compete. They may be right. The U.S. needs to proves them wrong.Critical minerals are geopolitical powerThe United States must now treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power. China already does. Escaping its grip will require more than mine permits and short-term funding. It demands a coherent, long-term strategy to build a complete supply chain that includes not only domestic capabilities but also reliable allies and partners. From mining and refining to magnet production and recycling, every link must be strengthened through targeted investment, permitting reform, and strategic coordination.A successful and sustainable policy requires commitment from one presidency to the next. Nor can the U.S. afford to engage allies and partners only rhetorically. Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, and Indonesia (among others) need sustained partnerships backed by financing, technology transfer, and critical infrastructure investments, not just our lectures on governance.The six-month export reprieve from China is not a solution — it is a stress test. It reveals whether the U.S. can finally focus and act, or whether it will retreat again into complacency. Beijing is betting it will be the latter. Washington must respond with urgency, unity, and a strategy equal to the scale of the challenge.

2025-06-29 11:15:00,Axios Explains: Inside ICE's superpowers,"The images of masked, heavily armed immigration agents snatching people off the streets and taking them away in unmarked cars have shocked many Americans — and led to a simple question: Is all of this legal? It is — at least for now.Why it matters: Since Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was created after the 9/11 attacks, its agents have operated with vastly more enforcement power, less transparency and fewer guardrails than local police.ICE's rules were designed largely to give the agency broad leeway in helping the FBI identify and arrest domestic terror suspects.Now the Trump administration is using that power to go after unauthorized immigrants — potentially millions of them — with a frequency and aggressiveness that has sent ripples through communities nationwide. Zoom in: Under Trump, critics say, ICE has become the closest thing the U.S. has to a secret police force.ICE agents aren't required to wear body cameras, can cover their faces, don't have to provide badge numbers or identify themselves, can arrive in unmarked cars and don't need a warrant from a judge to detain someone.Like those with other federal enforcement agencies, they can ignore rules that govern local police departments, particularly those local agencies with histories of abuse or that operate under court-imposed restrictions on racial profiling.In some cases, ICE agents can even arrest U.S. citizens — but they aren't supposed to place them in immigration detention units. Even so, a few U.S. citizens have been detained in recent ICE raids because of agents' mistakes or negligence. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has defended ICE agents' tactics and the covering of their faces, saying in a statement that they're ""facing a 500% increase in assaults against them while carrying out enforcement operations.""She blamed Democrats for ""violent rhetoric"" against ICE agents.Critics say there's no evidence of a 500% increase in assaults on ICE agents, and that agents still should follow the law.""The tactics are causing fear in our communities,"" Vanessa Cárdenas of the advocacy group America's Voice told Axios.Zoom out: ICE was formed in 2003. It was placed under the control of the new Department of Homeland Security and replaced the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), which had been under the Justice Department.To protect national security after the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, lawmakers gave ICE a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities.ICE initially didn't have the reputation of INS (known as ""La Migra"" to Latinos), but that changed under President Obama, when ICE expanded its operations to help carry out one of the largest deportations of unauthorized immigrants in decades.Immigrant rights groups began an ""Abolish ICE"" movement in 2018 — during President Trump's first term — as activists tried to bring attention to the agency's secretive tactics, which went unnoticed by most Americans. What can ICE doICE is tasked with enforcing the nation's immigration laws anywhere within the nation's interior (the Border Patrol's jurisdiction is 100 miles into the interior, from any land or maritime border).ICE agents can arrest anyone they suspect of being in the U.S. illegally. They can arrest U.S. citizens only if they see them ""breaking laws.""To conduct raids or operations targeting suspects, ICE agents only need an ""administrative warrant"" — a warrant signed by a supervisor, not a judge, Rebekah Wolf, director of the American Immigration Council's Immigration Justice Campaign, tells Axios.ICE agents can conceal their identities and refuse any request to disclose their personal information.This has led to conflicts between people ICE agents have encountered, as well as allegations by Trump's administration that protesters have tried to dox agents involved in raids. Wolf said officers in other agencies are required to identify themselves and provide badge numbers to prevent impersonators. ICE has no such requirement, and there have been reports of ICE impersonators harassing people, creating more chaos and uncertainty in some communities. ICE doesn't have to collect evidence for cases and has few parameters around its use of force. Because it's such a young agency, it hasn't faced many lawsuits and court challenges to its use-of-force policies, unlike other federal agencies such as the FBI, the Forest Service or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.That's resulted in few directives aimed at limiting ICE agents' tactics. ICE units can conduct pre-dawn raids, unannounced entries (with judicial or administrative warrants), and surveillance without many of the public accountability rules that serve as checks on local authorities.What ICE can't doICE agents can't enter a private home unless they have a judicial warrant.They still must adhere to the Constitution regarding the search and seizure limits protecting U.S. citizens.Although ICE isn't supposed to place U.S. citizens in immigration detention, Cárdenas says its agents have been detaining U.S.-born Latinos and dismissing their proof of citizenship as fake before eventually letting them go.This has led to allegations of racial profiling.ICE did not immediately respond for comment on these episodes.ICE also can't force a local law enforcement agency to join an operation, but police are obligated to keep order if protesters surround and ICE operation. The accountability questionAllegations of abuse by ICE agents rarely are investigated because they typically involve immigrants who are removed from the U.S., Wolf said.Any internal investigations are conducted by the DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or the department's inspector general.Joseph V. Cuffari, DHS's inspector general, was appointed by Trump during the president's first term and was not among the IGs Trump fired after taking office this year.Public accountability is limited for ICE agents — there are no regular civilian review boards and typically no body camera footage to use as evidence.What we're watching: Some immigration advocates and Democrats in Congress want to reduce ICE's powers. U.S. Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) has introduced legislation to prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks. Others are hoping federal court challenges lead to use-of-force limits and transparency that other federal law enforcement agencies have.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/29/axios-explains-inside-ice-superpowers,politics,

2025-06-29 10:45:00,Gen Z and millennials push into politics,"Data: Wikipedia; Note: If a mayor's exact birthdate was unavailable, January 1 of their birth year was used; Excludes Mark Freeman of Mesa, Ariz; Chart: Erin Davis/Axios VisualsA growing number of Gen Z and millennial Americans are seeking elected office — campaigning on the issues that matter most to them and their peers.Why it matters: The 119th Congress is the third oldest in U.S. history, and both of America's most recent presidents set records as the oldest ever inaugurated. As leadership skews older, young candidates from both parties are running to get their voices heard in local, state and federal government.The big picture: 74 millennials and one Gen Z-er were elected to the 119th Congress in November — making up 16% of the House and 8% of the Senate.Members of Gen Z also entered state and local office races.Case in point: Thousands of young progressives have expressed interest in running for office since Zohran Mamdani's New York City mayoral primary last week. Between Tuesday's primary and Friday afternoon, about 2,700 people signed up with Run for Something, an organization that supports young Democrats running for down-ballot office.Mamdani's race modeled ""what will make young people such compelling candidates in the future,"" says Amanda Litman, Run for Something co-founder and president. ""A real fluency with the internet, a real strong-held value system, the ability to be authentically themselves.""Zoom in: If elected in November, 33-year-old Mamdani would be the youngest among the mayors currently serving in the 50 largest American cities, according to an Axios analysis. He'd also be New York City's second-youngest mayor, after Hugh J. Grant in the late 19th century. His campaign — built more for TikTok than TV — resonated with young voters around the city and brought them to the polls.The other side: Run Gen Z, an organization that backs young conservatives running for office, is galvanizing the next generation of leaders on the right.The group has helped politicians like 22-year-old Wyatt Gable, who was elected to North Carolina's House of Representatives in November, and 26-year-old Amber Hulse, who just won a seat in South Dakota's senate.Gable told the Washington Post one of his priorities is implementing home economics education for high school students so they can graduate with practical skills, like financial literacy.The intrigue: Candidate age is becoming an increasingly important issue for American voters.67% of U.S. adults in a February YouGov poll said they believed maximum age limits should be imposed on elected officials. Democratic respondents were more likely than Republicans to support age limits. Reality check: Americans 62 and older still run for office at much higher rates than 18- to 25-year-olds, Tufts' Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement notes.But over the past decade, the number of young candidates appearing on local, state, and federal ballots has steadily increased.Go deeper: Zohran Mamdani's campaign was a perfect storm",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/29/gen-z-millennials-elections-zohran-mamdani,politics,

Gerry Connolly clinched the Democratic nomination to fill Connolly’s seat in a deep-blue Northern Virginia district, according to the local Democratic Party.James Walkinshaw won with 59.54% of the vote in Saturday’s party-run primary, according to results posted by the 11th Congressional District Democratic Committee of Virginia. He beat a field of 10 candidates that included state Sen. Stella Pekarsky and state Del. Irene Shin in the race for the special election nomination, according to NBC News. Shin finished in second place with 14.27% of the vote, while Pekarsky placed third with 13.40%, according to the party’s tabulation.Walkinshaw was Connolly’s chief of staff from 2009 to 2019 and has served on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors since 2020. Walkinshaw earned an endorsement from Connolly for this race before he died.Donald Trump8 hours agoTrump threatens backing primary challenge against GOP Sen. Thom Tillis over his ‘big, beautiful bill' voteHe ran a campaign focused on stopping Trump’s “dangerous” agenda, saying he would fight to protect the district’s more than 50,000 federal workers.“I’m honored & humbled to have earned the Democratic nomination for the district I’ve spent my career serving,” Walkinshaw said on X. “This victory was powered by neighbors, volunteers, and supporters who believe in protecting our democracy, defending our freedoms, and delivering for working families.”The race drew some outside spending, with Walkinshaw receiving over $2.4 million in support from Fight for Virginia’s Future and Protect Progress. Save Democracy PAC spent over $160,000 supporting Pekarsky, and People Over Monopolies spent almost $184,000 supporting Shin.Fight for Virginia’s Future also spent money on negative ads and robocalls criticizing Pekarsky for supporting a bill that would hold a referendum on a casino in Fairfax County.Walkinshaw will advance to the September special election, where he is the likely favorite to win, as then-Vice President Kamala Harris carried the district by 34 percentage points in 2024. He will face Republican Stewart Whitson, an Army veteran and former FBI official.This story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Also, officials said, two women, an 82-year-old and a 63-year-old, were taken to the hospital due to the incident — one due to smoke inhalation and the other because of burns she suffered in this fire.However, officials have not yet provided further identifying information on those hurt, but a fire official said one of the victims was listed in critical condition and the other was stable.In a Sunday afternoon update, a representative of City Council President Kenyatta Johnson said one of the injured women is a staffer in Johnson’s administrative office.“She has served through many council presidents. She is beloved. We like to call her the ‘council staffer at large’ because when you work for the council president’s office you work for everybody,” communications director for City Council, Vincent Thompson told NBC10. Also, the collapse may have been the result of an explosion, as neighbors told NBC10 that they heard a loud bang when the incident occurred.“Glass was breaking, debris was flying. I didn’t know what to do. I just took off running,” a neighbor said.Another neighbor, Michelle Noland, who lives behind the collapsed rowhomes, said her home has also been damaged.“Dining room window blown out,” she said. “Back door, sink... it took out the back of the house basically.”At least one other home nearby was deemed structurally unsound following the incident, but the owner of that home said his focus was on the families impacted by the collapsed homes. “We are praying for the family,” he said. In an update at about noon on Sunday, Mayor Cherelle Parker said the collapses happened as the result of an explosion, although fire officials have not confirmed an explosion took place. “An explosion occurred on the 1900 block of West Bristol Street,” said Parker, calling for prayer for the neighbors on the block and the first responders still working at the scene. Parker said she has met with the families of victims and said that there is a resource center set up for families impacted by this incident.Fire officials said the incident seems there may have been an explosion, but they are still working to determine the cause the fire that led to the collapse.Ten people who live in the area have been told to evacuate, officials said.

These incentives may include extra pay for a few months, healthcare coverage, and other employment services such as career counseling.Why is this beneficial for employers?Typically, voluntary programs are offered in order to avoid involuntary layoffs down the line.They allow for employees to retire early or make a career change. Christopher Nickson, vice president and senior consultant for HR firm Segal, explains that voluntary layoffs are often beneficial for companies looking to downsize their highest paid employees. “Oftentimes you are taking somebody who has worked for the organization for many years, and as time has gone on, their wages have gone up steadily as a factor of increased experience,” Nickson said. He points out they’ll typically be replaced by someone with less experience. “The result is they come in, typically at a [lower] compensation rate that’s beneficial to the company,” Nickson said.Essentially, companies view the voluntary programs as a more empathetic and transparent approach to cost savings than layoffs where employees are given no choice.But not all who are offered these programs agree. In April, Duke University announced a voluntary layoff program in order to cut 10% of the university’s costs, or roughly $350 million. The offer included compensation for one week of regular pay multiplied by years of service, maxing out at 26 weeks. In response members of the Duke community wrote a letter entitled “Duke, Don’t DOGE” to the university’s administration and president, Vincent E. Price, pointing out that cuts could be made elsewhere. The letter calls the voluntary layoffs “institutional hoarding.” It notes that some of the highest paid members of the institution (those making over $1 million), including Price, could take a 25% pay decrease, and those earning $500,000 to $1 million, could take a 10% decrease voluntarily and save Duke $6.6 million.“Duke is one of the first major universities in the country to enact sweeping layoffs across its workforce. This is a historic and devastating move,” the letter states. “And while workers are losing their jobs, housing, healthcare, and immigration status, Duke’s top administrators and athletics personnel continue to pull six-and seven-figure salaries. There are no cuts at the top. There’s no shared sacrifice. Just more for them—and less for everyone else.”Nickson argues that universities like Duke are in a tight spot since enrollment rates are dropping, and universities are seeing grant and funding cuts. Overall, Nickson believes these programs are a good way to minimize or avoid involuntary layoffs later on. “It’s a win for both the institution and for the individual,” he said.What to consider when offered a voluntary layoffIt can be difficult to decide whether or not you should take part in a voluntary layoff or buyout. Here are some factors to consider:Your likelihood of being laid off.Ask yourself—how likely is my position to be impacted later on? And, how strong is the current job market for someone with my experience and skills?“If you feel like you’re going to get laid off if you don’t take the severance, you may as well do it,” career coach and founder of Life after Layoff Bryan Creely said. “The voluntary severance is generally going to be more attractive because they’re trying to incentivize people. If you don’t take the voluntary severance and they move to eliminate your job anyway, it’s likely not going to be as attractive of a package.”Where you are in your career and what you want nextTaking a voluntary leave could open the doors for a career change, offering an exit from an unwanted job, or a ramp into retirement. Consider how easy will it be for you to pivot. Are you looking to switch industries entirely, which may take longer to find a job or gain additional certification? Or are you mid-level, at your career “prime” with a niche or specialized background where there’s demand for your skills? Are you close to retirement? Would taking a voluntary layoff allow you to financially and emotionally move on comfortably without having to find a new position?“Hypothetically, if you’re close to retirement and you have the option to take part in a voluntary layoff for one year’s payment, this is a great opportunity for you,” said Micah Alpern, senior managing director at CEO global advisory firm Teneo. “But, if you’re a young person, like a newer, tenured employee, this might be very negative to you if you receive four months’ severance but have to find a new job.” What is being offered and what are your rights?It may be helpful to enlist the help of a financial adviser, career coach, or legal counsel to understand the full scope of your needs and rights. As each program has different incentives and financial offerings, it is important to fully understand your offer before accepting or declining it, as each program varies with their incentives and financial offerings. Typically, taking a voluntary layoff means you still qualify for unemployment in most states. But, you should get a written statement from your employer, stating the reasons for the layoff.For better or for worse, there’s a good chance these programs will continue, as general rates of layoffs have remained consistent over the past few years in the U.S.“The layoff cycle is getting shorter and shorter. It used to be that there would be a layoff cycle that would happen once a decade,” Creely said. “Then COVID-19 hit, and now the layoff cycles have now gone from roughly every 8 to 10 years down to two years, or even shorter than that. I think they’re becoming a much more prevalent part of corporate culture unfortunately.”",fastcompany,https://www.fastcompany.com/91358448/what-are-voluntary-layoffs?partner=rss,politics,

2025-06-29 08:58:34,Pistons' Malik Beasley under federal investigation for NBA gambling allegations,"A body has been recovered and two women have been hospitalized after, officials said, after a fire caused at least three rowhomes in the city’s Nicetown section to collapse early Sunday.According to police, the incident happened after crews responded to a call for a fire at a section of row homes along the 1900 block of West Bristol Street at about 4:48 a.m. on Sunday.Less than 10 minutes after the initial call went out, officials confirmed the total collapse of three row homes.In a morning update, Assistant Fire Chief Charles Walker told NBC Philadelphia’s Neil Fischer that a body was recovered from the scene.Just before 5am, we responded to an explosion on Bristol St. in Nicetown. This became an all-hands response. There are 2 reported injuries and sadly, one reported fatality. Placed under control @ 6:33. Many partners still on scene & more info to come. pic.twitter.com/oHSHGi9ANY— Philadelphia Fire (@PhillyFireDept) June 29, 2025 The remains, that Walker said he believed belonged to a woman, were recovered by a K9 that was being used to do a search through the rubble.Also, he said, crews are working carefully to ensure that there isn’t an additional collapse as crews work at the scene.“This has been a very critical scene in regards to safety,” he said. Also, officials said, two women, an 82-year-old and a 63-year-old, were taken to the hospital due to the incident — one due to smoke inhalation and the other because of burns she suffered in this fire.However, officials have not yet provided further identifying information on those hurt, but a fire official said one of the victims was listed in critical condition and the other was stable.In a Sunday afternoon update, a representative of City Council President Kenyatta Johnson said one of the injured women is a staffer in Johnson’s administrative office.“She has served through many council presidents. She is beloved. We like to call her the ‘council staffer at large’ because when you work for the council president’s office you work for everybody,” communications director for City Council, Vincent Thompson told NBC10. Also, the collapse may have been the result of an explosion, as neighbors told NBC10 that they heard a loud bang when the incident occurred.“Glass was breaking, debris was flying. I didn’t know what to do. I just took off running,” a neighbor said.Another neighbor, Michelle Noland, who lives behind the collapsed rowhomes, said her home has also been damaged.“Dining room window blown out,” she said. “Back door, sink... it took out the back of the house basically.”At least one other home nearby was deemed structurally unsound following the incident, but the owner of that home said his focus was on the families impacted by the collapsed homes. “We are praying for the family,” he said. In an update at about noon on Sunday, Mayor Cherelle Parker said the collapses happened as the result of an explosion, although fire officials have not confirmed an explosion took place. “An explosion occurred on the 1900 block of West Bristol Street,” said Parker, calling for prayer for the neighbors on the block and the first responders still working at the scene. Parker said she has met with the families of victims and said that there is a resource center set up for families impacted by this incident.Fire officials said the incident seems there may have been an explosion, but they are still working to determine the cause the fire that led to the collapse.Ten people who live in the area have been told to evacuate, officials said. An investigation into this incident is still ongoing.This is a breaking news story. It will be updated as new information becomes available.

2025-06-30 11:03:18,"Robinhood expands its global push, minutes from crypto chief's old cramped apartment in Cannes","Robinhood crypto chief Johann Kerbrat returned to his hometown for the company’s most serious push yet to blend traditional finance with blockchain-based infrastructure. Robinhood is offering tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs across Europe, crypto staking in the U.S., perpetual futures for eligible EU traders, and a new Layer 2 blockchain. The announcement, timed with new European licenses and the Ethereum Community Conference, marks Robinhood’s biggest international crypto expansion to date.CANNES — Fifteen years after flipping burgers at a McDonald‘s and teaching himself to code at night in a cramped apartment near the French Riviera, Robinhood crypto chief Johann Kerbrat is back.The last time he lived around Cannes, he was 21 — with no connections, no funding, and no formal business training. But he had a knack for programming and a drive to solve real-world problems.Kerbrat, who is now senior vice president and crypto GM at Robinhood, quit his job just before starting university in nearby Nice, and soon after launched his first fintech startup: a no-code payments company built from scratch to help small merchants create e-commerce sites without hiring developers.“It was in my little studio — probably smaller than your bathroom,” he said. “Initially, we didn’t have any employees, but it was right at the beginning of e-commerce. Back then, if you were a merchant you didn’t really have an option, you had to hire an agency and spend tens of thousands of euros. The idea was to let people build their own thing without any technical knowledge — kind of what Shopify is doing now.”But the timing was right. The early 2010s brought a boom in online commerce, and Kerbrat’s tool gave small merchants a chance to compete. It also opened his eyes to how fragile and expensive the global financial system really was.A classmate from Greece told him how his family’s bank accounts had been frozen during the eurozone crisis. Around the same time, merchants using his platform were struggling with high fees, chargebacks, and fraud. And then the Bitcoin white paper landed.“I was like, ‘Okay, that’s a solution for everything,’ ” he saidNow, from Château de la Croix des Gardes, a Belle Époque mansion perched along the same coastline where he once lived and worked the night shift in fast food, he’s part of the most ambitious crypto product suite in Robinhood’s history.On Monday the company announced an expanded offering of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs across Europe, crypto staking in the U.S., perpetual futures for eligible EU traders, and a new Layer 2 blockchain optimized for real-world asset settlement and 24/7 trading.“It’s absolutely surreal,” said Kerbrat, seated inside the iconic Carlton Hotel — a five-star landmark that once felt impossibly out of reach. “When I was younger, I used to walk past this place — and I could have never, never stayed here.”The announcement coincides with the Ethereum Community Conference, hosted in Cannes for the first time, and Robinhood’s latest regulatory approvals across Europe.Robinhood’s latest move is its most serious push yet to blend traditional finance with blockchain-based infrastructure. Shares hit a record high following the announcement and are up over 100% this year.Kerbrat said the goal isn’t to dazzle with features. It’s to make crypto disappear into the background. He likened it to plumbing.“You don’t think about how water gets to your tap,” he said. “You just expect it to be there.”But there is still plumbing to build out.At the heart of Monday’s launch are tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs, now available to customers in 30 EU and European Economic Area countries. The tokens — built first on Arbitrum — offer 24/5 access, dividend support, and zero commission or spread from Robinhood. Eventually, they’ll migrate to a custom Layer 2 blockchain built to support tokenized assets, seamless bridging, and self-custody.In the U.S., Robinhood is debuting staking for Ethereum and Solana, allowing users to earn rewards by supporting network operations. In Europe, crypto perpetual futures will offer eligible users up to 3x leverage, routed through Bitstamp. Other upgrades include smart exchange routing, tax lot management, and advanced charting tools — all designed to make crypto feel as seamless and intuitive as trading stocks.“When we talk about mass adoption,” Kerbrat said, “This is what it looks like. A product people use — without needing to know how it works.”For Kerbrat, who spent his adolescence between Cannes and Nice, the return isn’t just symbolic. It’s a measure of how far he’s come — and how much still feels the same.His father worked in IT. His mother stayed home with him and his sister. One day, his dad brought home a clunky old Apple computer with a black-and-white screen and that was the spark. By 7, he was experimenting. By 11, he was programming regularly. And by 17, he was already trying to fix the broken parts of the internet economy he saw around him.His parents, now living further inland, drove in just in time to watch the launch. They remember the early days, he said — the tiny apartment, the first lines of code, the endless conversations with merchants who didn’t quite believe his pitch — that anyone could build an e-commerce site without knowing how to code.“We chose Cannes because of licensing, and because the conference was here,” he said. “But I’m not going to pretend it doesn’t feel good.”He paused, letting the moment settle.“I never thought I’d be back here like this.”",nbcphiladelphia,https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/robinhood-grows-its-global-crypto-footprint-with-u-s-stock-tokens-for-the-eu/4222350/,business,

2025-06-30 11:00:59,"In market rally back to record, best S&P 500 tech trade hasn't been ‘Mag 7' or tech sector itself","Stocks rose on Monday as increasing trade hopes among investors position Wall Street to close out a stunning month with even more record highs.The S&P 500 gained 0.2%, building on the record highs set in the previous session. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2% and had also reached fresh all-time highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 142 points, or 0.3%.Monday’s rise follows Canada rescinding its digital service tax in an effort to facilitate trade negotiations with the U.S. That’s after President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. was “terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada.” Initial payments on the tax were set to begin Monday and would have applied to companies such as Google, Meta and Amazon.Investors are awaiting the announcement of any trade deals between the U.S. and its trading partners, as Trump’s 90-day tariff reprieve is set to expire next week. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there are “countries that are negotiating in good faith.” However, he added that “if we can’t get across the line because they are being recalcitrant,” tariffs could still “spring back” to the levels announced on April 2.Deals on that front could be finalized once Trump’s “one, big, beautiful” bill passes, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” Monday. The package narrowly passed a key procedural vote in the Senate on Saturday night. If passed by the Senate, it faces an uncertain path in the House, where some GOP lawmakers have balked at revisions in the latest version of the bill.While the looming tariff deadline and tax bill could help spur volatility in the remainder of 2025, equity fundamentals and improving market breadth, among other factors, could mean that the recent momentum will continue, according to Terry Sandven of U.S. Bank Wealth Management.“The wall of worry is crumbling as stocks reach all-time highs,” said the chief equity strategist, whose year-end target implies more than 2% upside in the S&P 500 from Friday’s close. “Inflation is stable, interest rates are range-bound and earnings are trending higher. That’s a favorable backdrop for stocks to continue to forge higher as we begin the second half.”Monday marks the last day of June, a month in which the major averages have staged a sharp recovery back to record levels. The S&P 500 is up more than 4% this month, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has jumped more than 6%. The Dow, meanwhile, has added about 4% month to date.Prior to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting all-time highs Friday, global trade and tariff tensions rocked the market, putting the broad market index within striking distance of a bear market in early April. It’s now on pace to finish the quarter with solid gains, along with the other two leading indexes. The S&P 500 has surged more than 10% quarter to date, while the Nasdaq and Dow are more than 17% and more than 4% higher in the period.Coinbase is the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in JuneCoinbase is the top performer in the S&P 500 fpr the month of June, boosted by positive regulatory updates, product launches and, of course, its very inclusion in the benchmark stock index at the end of May.The crypto exchange is now on pace for its best month since November, third straight monthly gain — 43% in June alone — and its first three-month rally since the end of 2023. On Thursday, the stock hit its highest level since the day of its initial public offering in 2021.The surge this month comes as investor attention shifts away from Coinbase’s core business, trading, to stablecoins and other ways crypto can provide utility. Even with Coinbase’s 43% run this month, the stock has room to appreciate further, analysts say, as the market isn’t fully connecting the dots around Coinbase’s close relationship with stablecoin issuer Circle.— Tanaya MacheelRobinhood, Cava among the stocks making moves middayCheck out the stocks making big midday moves:Robinhood — Shares of the brokerage app provider popped 10% and touched a fresh 52-week high.

Our economists assume consumers will absorb 70% of the direct cost of tariffs,” David Kostin, Goldman’s head of U.S. equity strategy, said in a note to clients.The Wall Street firm said the effective U.S. tariff rate based on announced policies has risen by roughly 10 percentage points to 13%. Goldman’s economists believe the effective tariff rate will eventually be increased by an additional 4 percentage points to 17%“Analyst revisions to margin estimates have been more negative for companies most exposed to tariffs compared with the typical stock.

As soon as the tax bill is passed, I think that there’s going to be a marathon session in the Oval where we’ll go through them one by one with the president and we’ll make the final calls,” Hassett said.The White House official also indicated that the recent negotiations with Canada over the country’s digital services tax could also be key in other talks.“My expectation is that the digital services taxes around the world will be taken off, and that will be a key part of the ongoing trade negotiations that we have,” Hassett said.— Jesse PoundFed stress tests could be a ‘shot in the arm’ for bank stocks, Bank of America saysMajor bank stocks were poised to open higher on Monday after all of them passed the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test.Shares of Goldman Sachs were up 3.4% in premarket trading. Wells Fargo added 1.8%, while Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase each rose less than 1%. Bank of America‘s stock added 1.2%.On the whole, banks saw a smaller decline in the common equity tier 1 capital ratio in this year’s test than last year’s, though this latest test scenario was less severe, the Fed said. Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala described Goldman’s year over year improvement in the test as “significant” and also said that Citigroup’s results could lead to more share buybacks. “We see results to serve as a shot in the arm for the group, among GSIBs highlight Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo as offering the best risk/reward,” Poonawala said.— Jesse PoundTariffs can still ‘spring back’ to April 2 levels for some countries, Bessent saysBessent told Bloomberg News on Monday that reverting back to the tariffs announced on “liberation day” is still an option for some countries as the Trump administration continues trade negotiations.“We have countries that are negotiating in good faith, but they should be aware that if we can’t get across the line because they are being recalcitrant, then we could spring back to the April 2 level. I hope that won’t have to happen,” Bessent said.When those tariff levels were originally announced, the stock market fell sharply before Trump paused the levies a week later.

We’re going to have a lot that’s unknown about how other policies are impacting the labor market. And without that kind of clarity, I don’t think it’s going to be my view that it’ll be appropriate to move in any direction at this point,” Bostic said.Tackling the issue of when the data might be sufficient to support a move, Bostic said the Fed would be closely monitoring how businesses and consumers respond to tariffs and other economic factors.“I’m hearing more [businesses] say that they may not expect this whole thing to play out, to where they’re at their final strategy, till even 2026, so this could be a much more extended period than I think many expect,” he told CNBC.— Jenni ReidAsia-Pacific markets trade mixed as investors parse a slew of data releases Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Monday as investors parsed details on trade negotiations and a slew of data points, including South Korea and Japan’s industrial output figures for May and China’s purchasing managers’ index readings for June.China’s manufacturing activity contracted for the third consecutive month in June, fueling hopes for more stimulus to cushion the impact of ongoing trade disruptions between the superpower and the U.S.Mainland China’s CSI 300 index added 0.37% to end the day at 3,936.08, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.87% to 24,072.28.Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 0.84% to end the day at 40,487.39 after hitting an over 11-month high earlier in the session, while the broader Topix index advanced 0.43% to 2,852.84.In South Korea, the Kospi index closed 0.52% higher at 3,071.70, while the small-cap Kosdaq was flat at 781.50.Over in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 increased by 0.33% to end the day at 8,542.30.Meanwhile, India’s benchmark Nifty 50 lost 0.53% while the BSE Sensex dropped 0.54% as at 1.45 p.m. Indian Standard Time.— Amala BalakrishnerMore S&P 500 companies issuing positive Q2 earnings guidance compared to averageMore companies in the S&P 500 are issuing positive earnings guidance for the second quarter than average, according to FactSet.Over 110 companies in the broad-market index have given quarterly EPS guidance for the second quarter.

(""Jazz"") regarding the FDA's approval of LUMRYZTM, the first and only once-at-bedtime oxybate treatment for cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy.""The unanimous decision by the Appeals Court panel upholding the FDA's approval of LUMRYZ underscores the importance of its innovative formulation and validates its benefits for people with narcolepsy,"" said Greg Divis, Chief Executive Officer at Avadel Pharmaceuticals. ""The ruling affirms the FDA's decision, which the Appeals Court noted was undisputed, that LUMRYZ's once-at-bedtime dosing is clinically superior to all first generation, immediate-release oxybates and provides a major contribution to patient care.""""Importantly, with this ruling, LUMRYZ will continue to be available for narcolepsy patients to consistently experience the benefits of a full, therapeutic, once-at-bedtime dose of oxybate therapy offering the potential for an uninterrupted night's sleep. We will continue advancing our commercial strategy to ultimately transform the sleep treatment paradigm for the narcolepsy community and increase the number of patients well beyond the thousands currently treated with LUMRYZ,"" continued Mr. Divis.Following the District Court's ruling in favor of the FDA and Avadel in October 2024, which granted the FDA's Motions for Summary Judgment with respect to Jazz's complaint and denied Jazz's Motion for Summary Judgment, Jazz filed a notice of appeal to the Appeals Court.

On October 16, 2024, LUMRYZ was additionally approved as a once-at-bedtime treatment for cataplexy or EDS in pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy.The FDA approval of LUMRYZ was supported by results from REST-ONTM, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 trial in adults with narcolepsy. LUMRYZ demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the three co-primary endpoints: EDS (MWT), clinicians' overall assessment of patients' functioning (CGI-I), and cataplexy attacks, for all three evaluated doses when compared to placebo.With its approvals in May 2023 and October 2024, the FDA also granted 7 years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity to LUMRYZ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in adults with narcolepsy and in pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy (respectively) due to a finding of clinical superiority of LUMRYZ relative to currently available oxybate treatments. In particular, the FDA found that LUMRYZ makes a major contribution to patient care over currently available, twice-nightly oxybate products by providing a once-nightly dosing regimen that avoids nocturnal arousal to ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/06/g46164897/avadel-pharmaceuticals-announces-unanimous-appeals-court-decision-upholding-fda-approval-of-lumryz,business,

Allied With Socialist Operative Linked To Marxist Terror Group Americans were stunned last week when foreign-born, self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani used CNN as a platform to denounce capitalism—the very system that transformed this country from frontier towns into a global superpower. Capitalism has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, built a middle class, and fueled rapid technological innovation—outcomes impossible under socialist regimes, as evidenced by an imploding Europe adopting welfare-state models or failed communist states like Cuba. Yet Mamdani chose to vilify it on national television. His profoundly anti-American rhetoric didn't emerge out of nowhere—one has to wonder whether it's rooted in foreign influence or ideology imported from an adversary.CNN: “Do you like capitalism?”Zohran Mamdani: “No. I have many critiques of capitalism.

David Duhalde's position at the New York City Campaign Finance Board gave him unfettered access to confidential information about political candidates and the ability to influence campaign compliance. He openly backed Democratic Socialist (DSA) Assemblyman Mamdani, whose rise ultimately helped secure victory in last week's Democratic mayoral primary against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Duhalde lists himself as a NYC Campaign Finance Board employee on LinkedIn.Within that timeframe...Note: Duhalde, who identified himself in a 2020 article as the deputy director of the DSA...... tweeted his support for Zohran's mayoral run on October 23, 2024, but previous tweets show that their work relationship dates back to at least 2022. After the NYPost article went live, Duhalde deleted his Facebook and Instagram.Duhalde also sits on DSA's International Committee, which has ties to socialist regimes in Venezuela and Cuba and has partnered with Friends of Socialist China and The People's Forum.In 2024, Duhalde wrote, ""A history of the late 2000s youth section of the Democratic Socialists of America and how they used lessons from Mao and contemporary labor to reevaluate their conditions and build a winning strategy."" Further raising concerns, Duhalde's last-known romantic partner, Michelle Munjanattu, is a member of Samidoun, a front group for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)—a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, according to Anderson.Duhalde (right) posed next to Michelle Munjanattu at the University of Maryland’s Socialist Night Club in 2019. (NYPost) Love is in the air (NYPost) Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, or ""Samidoun,"" was recently labeled a terrorist entity by Canada and sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury as a ""sham charity that serves as an international fundraiser for PFLP."" Using publicly available data, PFLP has a troubling connection to Bank Saderat Iran—a U.S.-sanctioned financial institution designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in September 2006 under Executive Order 13224 for financing terrorism, including support to groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the PFLP itself.The PFLP's ""Resistance Until Victory"" manifesto declares its identity as a Marxist-Leninist organization, calling for the destruction of the Israeli state and advocating for the use of the revolutionary socialist movement to overthrow capitalism. Mamdani's anti-American rhetoric shouldn't come as a surprise—it's not just a byproduct of progressive academia but also stems from the far-left international groups he's tied to, either directly or indirectly. Whether through members of his political team or the DSA, the connections to foreign adversaries and very questionable groups have raised alarm bells.

2025-06-30 10:53:48,White House expects more countries will drop digital services taxes after Canada backs down,"The White House said it will likely ask more countries to drop their digital services taxes as part of ongoing trade talks with the Trump administration. The remark from National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett came shortly after Canada rescinded its DST. President Donald Trump had threatened to cut off all trade talks with Ottawa in retaliation for the tax.The White House will likely ask more countries to drop their digital services taxes as part of ongoing trade talks, a senior Trump administration official said Monday after Canada rescinded its DST over the weekend.“My expectation is that the digital services taxes around the world will be taken off, and that that will be a key part of the ... ongoing trade negotiations that we have,” National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.”The remark from one of President Donald Trump‘s top advisors came the day after Canada walked back its DST in order to “advance broader trade negotiations” with the United States.That reversal — just hours before the first collection under the new tax was due — came on the heels of Trump’s surprise threat Friday to terminate all trade talks with Ottawa as long as the DST remained in place.Negotiations with the U.S. have resumed, Canada said, since it scrapped the tax. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney now aim to strike a trade deal by July 21, according to a Sunday statement from the Department of Finance in Ottawa. “I’m very pleased to see that Canada is removing its DST, which means that we didn’t have to put in this really complicated retaliation to the tax code,” Hassett said Monday morning.“But you could expect that countries that have digital sales taxes of the future are going to be facing the wrath of [U.S. Trade Representative] Jameson Greer” over “these unfair trade practices,” Hassett said.

Don Bacon to retire, Omaha swing district now a top target for Dems In a little over a week, the Trump administration faces multiple self-imposed trade deadlines, when steep U.S. tariffs on a number of countries are set to restart. Hassett said he believes the U.S. has “frameworks” for “a whole number of deals” that will be agreed to shortly after a major Trump-backed budget bill is passed through Congress.The Trump administration is eager for the GOP-controlled House and Senate to pass a final version of the massive tax-and-spending legislation and send it to the president’s desk before Friday.If that happens, Hassett predicted that there will be a “marathon session” in the Oval Office in which Trump and his aides will tick down a list of countries and make final calls on U.S. tariff rates for each.It is unclear whether Trump will stick to the July 8 and 9 tariff deadlines. “We can do whatever we want,” he said when asked last week about whether he would stick with one of those dates.",nbcdfw,https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/money-report/white-house-expects-more-countries-will-drop-digital-services-taxes-after-canada-backs-down/3874771/,business,

2025-06-30 11:00:20,Canada talks show tariffs create new world for investors,"The S&P 500 was on track to hit a new record on Friday, but then sank when President Trump announced the termination of trade talks with Canada over a controversial digital services tax.Within an hour, investors decided not to care, and stocks closed at an all-time high for the first time since February.Why it matters: Wall Street is largely post-tariff. The market is a forward-looking machine, and it's already priced in better-than-expected trade deals before they are signed.What they're saying: Headline-driven volatility is a given under this administration, so don't let it impact your portfolio, advisors say. (Example A: Canada scrapped the aforementioned tax Sunday night.)Jay Pelosky of TPW Advisors says he pays ""no attention"" to tariff policy anymore.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo, indicated that Trump may be ""outsmarting everyone"" in a recent note, arguing any extension of the 90-day tariff pause, which Trump has signaled, would decrease uncertainty.Lower uncertainty is good news for both businesses and investors.Friday's action was ""reflecting the improved investor sentiment and overall investor confidence,"" says Mike Dickson, head of research and quantitative strategies at Horizon Investments.Zoom in: There are several bullish signals that strategists would rather focus on than tariffs, which fueled the 19% drop in stocks just a couple months ago.Expectations are building around the ""big, beautiful bill"" being passed sooner rather than later, which could be a fresh catalyst.Recent declines in the dollar may be a long-term risk, but for now, this could be a cushion that drives earnings beats across the big tech names.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent continues to pitch an economic agenda built on a three-legged stool — tax, trade and deregulation — as investors salivate over the prospect of looser government oversight.Reality check: Economists caution that a slowdown in consumer spending, which is already happening, could worsen as tariff-driven inflation takes full effect.It will be another couple of months until we know how much increased tariffs have affected inflation, according to Joe Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US.""It's summer silly season,"" says Brusuelas, who cautions investors that FOMO is driving positive sentiment while risks remain.He argues a reassessment of valuations will come when, not if, the data shows further tariff impacts.The other side: Some hyper-optimistic strategists may argue a slowdown in consumer spending off the back of higher prices is bullish since there could be a subsequent rebound if trade deals are struck.Spending slowed when uncertainty was at a record high. If uncertainty wanes, maybe spending roars right back. The argument clashes directly with the idea that the inflation driven by tariffs is just beginning.The bottom line: Consensus is building around the idea that investors can stomach headline volatility around policy uncertainty, but they can't afford to miss out on the rallies that come after.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/06/30/canada-trump-tariffs-wall-street,politics,

2025-06-30 10:38:00,The rise of AI in CEO communications—and the credibility threat it poses,"CEOs have become more than just corporate leaders—they’re among the most valuable assets on the balance sheet. Great leadership can drive billions in market cap by shaping narratives and galvanizing stakeholders. But what happens when the communication tools they use to build credibility start to erode it?We’re entering a new era in CEO communications, one where human messages increasingly filter through the lens of AI. Analysts and investors have long leaned on AI-powered language models and sentiment analysis to dissect earnings calls, parsing executive tone, word choice, and delivery for signals on strategy, risk, or future performance. Now, CEOs and their teams are flipping the script—crafting messages with the help of generative AI to appeal to the very same systems analyzing them.It’s a feedback loop of machines talking to machines. And while the tech arms race might make earnings calls look polished and sentiment scores spike, it also risks creating a sentiment gap. In the end, credibility is still the most valuable currency in leadership—and AI can’t replace that.The CEO Premium Meets the AI Arms RaceCorporate valuation has always been about more than just numbers. Investors have baked intangibles like brand equity, leadership narratives, and cultural impact into their models. As NYU finance professor Aswath Damodaran puts it, valuation is as much about a company’s story as it is about spreadsheets.The CEO’s job is to integrate those stories with their strategies. Jensen Huang didn’t make Nvidia a trillion-dollar company because of flawless financial execution—he did it by selling a vision of AI as the engine of the future, powering everything from healthcare to climate solutions. That’s the CEO premium in action: the ability to turn a strategic story into market-moving value. But here’s what no one’s saying out loud: when that story is over-engineered with AI, something critical is lost.Consider this: Bank of America’s S&P 500 corporate sentiment tracker, based on an analysis of thousands of earnings transcripts, hit an all-time high earlier this year, even as analysts lowered growth expectations for 2025. The disconnect is stark. While executives are optimizing their tone and language to look and sound bullish, it’s masking underlying realities.We’re looking at a sentiment bubble, where polished communications are designed to impress algorithms but are creating distance from actual performance. The result? A risk to long-term stakeholder confidence and broader market integrity.The Credibility Gap is Real–and RiskyAI-powered communications is an incredible asset. It can help executives sharpen their messages, anticipate audience reactions, and streamline delivery. But when it starts to obscure reality—or worse, is used as a veil—it risks blowing up the most important thing any CEO has: credibility.Markets thrive on credibility. Investors place a premium on CEOs who communicate clearly and consistently, and are transparent about their strengths and challenges. When communication becomes engineered for algorithms rather than stakeholders, it creates a hollow effect—polished on the surface, but leaving questions below.This is more than theoretical. A recent study published in Harvard Business Review found that employees rated CEO messages as less helpful if they thought the message was AI-generated—even when it wasn’t. Perception alone was enough to damage trust. That finding underscores the growing credibility risk CEOs face when misusing or leaning too heavily on AI.What CEOs Need to Do NowSo where does this leave us? The CEOs who win in this new reality won’t be the ones with the most AI-polished messaging—they’ll be the ones who balance technology with authenticity. Here’s how:Speak to Stakeholders, Not Just Algorithms: Say what you mean. Own the hard truths. AI should enhance a message, not sanitize it. AI-generated communications might score well with language models, but stakeholders—investors, employees, customers—aren’t grading on polish. They’re looking for clarity.Anchor Narratives in Performance: Narratives drive valuation, but they’re meaningless without numbers. If the results are strong, show your math. If they’re weak, explain why. Don’t let AI overinflate optimism. Instead, use it to sharpen transparency.Ensure AI Augments, Not Replaces: AI is great for refining delivery and identifying blind spots, but it can’t replace human judgment or instinct. Companies that over-rely on AI-driven clones or sentiment engineering risk losing the real connection that drives stakeholder engagement.Anticipate the Credibility Pivot: As sentiment inflation continues, markets will inevitably adjust. Investors will begin looking for the next differentiator, pivoting from polished delivery to deeper signals of authenticity. CEOs who lean into direct, unvarnished communication will stand out.Get Ahead of What’s Coming: The tools analyzing your every word are only getting more advanced. The only sustainable strategy? Consistency. Authenticity. Messages that hold up under scrutiny—algorithmic or human. If your leadership story can’t survive deep analysis, it was never leadership to begin with.The Way Forward: Still a Human GameAI is reshaping the rules of executive communications, but the most successful leaders will recognize that technology is a supporting act—not the star of the show. At the end of the day, the algorithms don’t close deals, inspire employees, or build relationships with customers—CEOs do.In this next chapter of leadership, The CEOs who win won’t be the ones scoring highest on sentiment trackers. They’ll be the ones who use AI responsibly, stay grounded in performance, and lead with clarity and authenticity. Because when machines talk past each other, the whole system breaks down.Credibility is still the most valuable asset a CEO has. And no algorithm can replace that.",fastcompany,https://www.fastcompany.com/91358554/the-rise-of-ai-in-ceo-communications-and-the-credibility-risk-it-poses-ai-corporate-communication-ceos?partner=rss,politics,

2025-06-30 10:00:00,5 unexpected roadblocks for women entrepreneurs—and how to overcome them,"Every entrepreneur faces challenges on their professional path. Many women, in particular, share experiences of doubt and difficulty in making their voices heard. But rest assured, there are tried-and-true ways to get you past these speed bumps and back onto the right track. In my two-decade career at Christie’s auction house, I learned to navigate these dynamics. And when I eventually left to start my own talent agency, I had to use strategies I learned from my time in the male-dominated corporate world to get buy-in from new clients. My ability to speak up in rooms full of men, pitch ideas to them, and feel confident doing so proved to be critical.The truth is, entrepreneurial life can have a higher barrier to entry for many women. But common obstacles don’t need to stop you in your tracks. Here are five hidden roadblocks women should anticipate—so you, too, can approach any business challenge confident in your ability to own it. Decision-makers don’t look like youA common issue women face when they walk into a pitch meeting is a room full of people who don’t look like them. As a result, when they start to pitch their product or idea, the people in the room can’t relate and the deal falls apart quickly. But knowing this will likely be the case gives you all the power. Do your research before you walk in the room so that you know exactly who you are going to be pitching to—that way, there are no surprises. Find out as much as possible about everyone who will be in the room so that you can find a natural point of synergy to connect you. Since you’ve done the prework, you can ask leading questions that will steer the conversation in the way that you want. Don’t hesitate to practice your pitch on friends who might be similar to the people you are about to pitch to, so they can punch holes in your presentation. The more prep work you do, the easier pitch day will be.Juggling invisible laborAre you drained at the end of the workday, only to walk in the door at home to find that you are in charge of everything there, too? The second shift is a common trap for working women. And it can stop today.Have conversations with your partner early and often about dividing invisible work at home. The sooner you get into a rhythm where you’re both aware of what it takes to keep a household moving, the less time you will spend arguing about it. Together, list out everything that has to get done around the house, and allocate it according to the things you are good at or like to do—until you get to the tasks neither of you want to do. Tackle those together. You can’t do it alone, nor should you.Limited access to funding Women have access to less than 3% of venture capital money; it’s a shocking disparity that bears repeating. So be loud. This statistic will only improve the more we talk about it. Tell anyone and everyone who needs to hear it that women need more access to capital. If you’re a woman seeking VC money, get in touch with organizations like Female Founder Collective or Female Founders Fund, who help connect women with potential investors (and invest as well). Make the issue known, and align yourself with communities working to solve it.Limited access to networks My father always says “network or die”—meaning not that you’ll die if you don’t network, but your network certainly will. Fewer women than men in positions of business leadership means that curating connections is essential. If you find that your network isn’t growing, or your world seems small and you need a larger reach, it’s time to take matters into your own hands. Organize a breakfast with a friend and ask her to invite six people you don’t know. Do the same with your network. Make it meaningful, not just transactional. At the event, let each person talk about their work and life, then ask a question that everyone at the table has to answer. Artificial timelinesThe world of constant updates that we live in can make success seem easy—as though if you aren’t killing it all the time, you aren’t successful. If you find yourself scrolling on social media, concerned that everyone else is miles ahead of where you are supposed to be, say this to yourself as often as you need to: “I am living life on the timeline I am supposed to be on. Things will happen when they are meant to happen and not before. I am exactly where I need to be.” You will arrive—roadblocks in your rearview mirror.",fastcompany,https://www.fastcompany.com/91359963/5-unexpected-roadblocks-for-women-entrepreneurs-and-how-to-overcome-them?partner=rss,politics,

2025-06-30 09:30:00,New docs get schooled in old diseases as vaccine rates fall,"Rush University Medical Center in Chicago is adding a new twist to its curriculum for medical students and residents, using AI tools and learning modules to teach how to more quickly identify measles rashes on different skin tones.Why it matters: It's another reminder that diseases once thought to have been eradicated are showing up with increased frequency in clinics and ERs, posing challenges for younger physicians and health workers who thought they were relegated to history.Lingering vaccine hesitancy and distrust of the medical establishment stoked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are leading some health systems to add training on old scourges that were practically wiped out by immunization campaigns and increased surveillance.""You're taught these things in medical school, and you're taught from a very academic perspective with the sense of measles was eradicated in 2000,"" said Nicholas Cozzi, EMS medical director at Rush.""Now we're having a resurgence, the highest in 25 years, and you might have not reviewed that since the first year of medical school,"" he added. ""It's a new paradigm and a new normal that we have to adapt to.""The big picture: The focus is particularly acute on childhood illnesses such as measles, chicken pox, invasive strep pneumoniae and pertussis, experts told Axios.Polio and diphtheria, covered by the DTap vaccine, are also a concern. An unvaccinated 10-year-old boy died in Germany after contracting diphtheria, once the leading cause of premature death of children.Rubella — a less easily transmitted infection covered by the MMR vaccine — can also be a threat, because of the way it can infect a fetus during pregnancy, said Catherine Troisi, professor at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and chair-elect of the International Network of Epidemiology in Policy.Vaccination rates for U.S. kindergartners were down slightly in 2023-24 for the DTap, polio, chickenpox and MMR shots, according to CDC data.Zoom in: Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said rotavirus is another old disease that's being introduced to younger doctors.""That virus dominated my residency [in the 1970s]. We had 400 kids admitted every winter,"" Offit said. That was before a vaccine was licensed in 2006 and virtually eliminated 70,000 hospitalizations with severe diarrhea annually, he added. ""Now it's the rare child who ever gets admitted. Most pediatric residents have never seen a case of rotavirus-induced dehydration in the hospital,"" he said.Between the lines: Incidents such as the measles outbreak in Texas and Kennedy's recent changes to federal vaccine policy are heightening vigilance and forcing updates to physician training.It will likely take time for medical schools and residency programs to formally change their training, Troisi pointed out.Medical professionals are being advised to stay current on public health advisories, ask patients about travel histories and be on guard for less likely conditions that may present as more common ailments.They may also have to brush up on best practices for spinal taps in infants and toddlers, an invasive diagnostic tool that is seldom used today but can quickly turn up telltale signs such as inflamed membranes, said Adrianna Cadilla, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Nemours Children's Health in Orlando.""When I trained, I would hear my attendings tell us about how often they had to do lumbar punctures because that was when Hemophilus influenza type B was running rampant,"" Cadilla said. ""I only got to do probably one every ER shift, but that was a lot in comparison to now.""The hospital is using simulations to get medical students and residents more experienced in doing spinal tap on infants and wriggling older children, she said.What to watch: New outbreaks could force more on-the-fly adjustments, especially in areas with low vaccination rates and the prospect of fewer recommended childhood immunizations.Artificial intelligence is an emerging as a valuable tool in more quickly recognizing the medical conditions that may be of greater concern, Cozzi said.

2025-06-30 08:15:00,Traditional business planning doesn’t cut it anymore. Here’s what leaders should embrace instead,"In 2019, a midsized company used a familiar tool: the classic 2×2 scenario matrix. They mapped two axes of uncertainty: economic stability and technological innovation. From that, they built four polished narratives of the future. At the time, it felt rigorous and strategic.Then everything changed.Generative AI erupted into public consciousness. With the release of GPT-3 and a cascade of tools that followed, a technological tidal wave reshaped industries, workflows, and public discourse. Billions of AI-generated images, voices, and texts flooded the digital world. At the same time, resistance grew. Workers voiced concerns about job displacement, regulators scrambled to keep pace, and the public began questioning the speed and direction of changes ahead.Not one of the company’s four boxes accounted for this kind of multidimensional disruption.The Future Didn’t Fall Into One of Four BoxesWhy did their scenarios fall short? Because the 2×2 model, and much of traditional scenario planning, was designed for a more linear, less entangled world. It reduces complex systems into binary trade-offs and often fails to consider the social, emotional, and symbolic forces that drive real transformation.Today’s world is shaped by what we call SuperShiftsTM, nine deep, structural transformations that are changing how we live, learn, and work. These include forces such as IntelliFusion, where human and artificial intelligence merge; Techceleration, where technology evolves faster than regulation or adaptation; and Reality Remix, where the physical and digital worlds merge. These are not isolated trends. They are interconnected systemic changes that defy prediction and demand a more sophisticated strategic response.In a world of SuperShifts, planning for the most probable future is no longer enough. We need approaches that embrace complexity, expand foresight, and prepare us for disruptions that do not fit neatly into grids or quadrants.The Problem: Classic Scenarios in a Complex WorldTraditional scenario planning emerged in an era that felt more stable and linear. The 2×2 model simplifies uncertainty by forcing it into four tidy boxes. For a long time, that structure helped organizations think beyond the status quo. But in today’s world, it misses the mark.Leaders now face overlapping disruptions in climate, technology, society, and geopolitics. These aren’t isolated variables; they are interconnected forces that influence and accelerate one another. Trying to capture this level of complexity within a binary framework reduces rich dynamics into simplistic either-or choices. The result? Shallow narratives that feel disconnected from reality.SuperShifts expose the limits of these old tools. Consider the rise of decentralized governance, AI-human collaboration, or the fragmentation of global systems. These are not subtle evolutions; they are foundational shifts that rewrite the rules of society, economics, and identity. No quadrant can contain that.In a world shaped by systems thinking, nonlinear change, and emotional complexity, traditional scenario methods often flatten what needs to be multidimensional. They strip away nuance, ignore lived experience, and fail to account for emerging tensions that matter most. We need scenario tools that reflect the world we are in now: fast-moving, emotionally charged, and shaped by forces that don’t sit still.Enter the Spectrum Foresight FrameworkInstead of jumping straight into scenarios, Spectrum Foresight FrameworkTM begins with what we call Spectrum Shaping, vivid, layered vignettes of possible futures. These aren’t just speculative stories. They are grounded in Spectrum Layer AnalysisTM (SLA), a seven-layer method that brings emotional, systemic, and symbolic depth to each imagined world.Each Spectrum Shaping is a microcosm, a lived moment in a future shaped by shifts that are already underway. They reflect not just what happens, but how it feels, who it impacts, and what tensions emerge.For example, a Spectrum Shaping built around the rise of AI in mental health might feature:Headlines about virtual therapists replacing human counselors.Systemic drivers, such as underfunded healthcare or surges in AI investment.Power struggles between tech firms and clinical boards.Emotional responses range from relief to existential dread.Cultural narratives about vulnerability and machine empathy.Going Deeper: Spectrum Layer AnalysisWithin the Spectrum Shaping stage, it utilizes Spectrum Layer Analysis to uncover the layered forces that shape how futures are experienced, not just predicted. SLA is the deep-structure engine behind immersive futures. Rather than crafting flat narratives based on trends, SLA challenges foresight teams to analyze each Spectrum Scene across seven interlocking layers, from observable events to unconscious cultural metaphors. These layers create the world-building scaffolding that turns weak signals into richly textured future scenes. SLA moves foresight from descriptive to dimensional. It moves beyond surface speculation to construct futures that account for identity, power, emotional context, and systemic drivers. And these layers can fall into seven categories:Surface Events and Discourse: Observable signals like headlines, memes, or emerging technologiesStructures and Systemic Drivers: Institutional, technological, or infrastructural dynamics beneath the surfacePower and Agency: Who holds power, who is excluded, and how agency is negotiatedCultural and Psychological Frames: Collective mindsets, fears, values, and assumptionsConflicts and Tensions: Fractures, resistance, and ideological frictionNarratives and Beliefs: Deep-rooted stories that guide behavior and justify decisionsArchetypes and Deep Metaphors: The symbolic frameworks and recurring motifs that shape perceptionBy scanning each layer in tandem, organizations can trace how a surface trend, such as AI regulation, may be driven not just by policy shifts but also by deeper stories of control, freedom, fear, and trust. This layered analysis reveals not only what might happen but also why and how it could unfold differently across cultures, industries, or generations.Making business strategy more flexibleSLA ensures you’re not just reacting to what’s visible. It helps you understand why shifts are occurring and how they might evolve differently across cultures, markets, or generations. It bridges foresight and strategy, anchoring each insight in emotional, symbolic, and structural realities. SLA makes strategy stretchable, robust across multiple futures, yet flexible when the unexpected hits. It’s the world-building tool that prepares Spectrum Shaping for their next evolution: full-fledged Spectrum Scenarios.Why you should look at business scenarios with layers Spectrum Scenarios are not just upgraded narratives: they’re a sophisticated, next-generation foresight method that moves beyond the constraints of traditional scenario planning. Each scenario reflects a different way of living, interpreting, and engaging with a future shaped by shared underlying shifts. Unlike traditional scenarios that often rely on archetypes, quadrant-based methods (like 2×2 matrices), or linear forecasts, which produce a limited number of binary outcomes based on two critical uncertainties, Scenarios are multilayered, emotionally resonant, and systemically grounded. They reflect the contradictions, power asymmetries, and diverse worldviews that make strategic planning more human and more real.What Makes It DifferentThink of these scenarios as parallel “lived realities” within the same domain, sometimes in the same city, company, or policy environment, but experienced radically differently depending on power, identity, worldview, or system position. Instead of reducing uncertainty to polar opposites like “AI will be regulated” versus “AI will not be regulated,” this approach examines the full range in between. It considers possibilities from tightly controlled AI ecosystems to completely open-source models with minimal oversight. These spectrums are not just visual enhancements. They fundamentally change how leaders think about uncertainty, complexity, and strategic risk.Traditional Scenario MethodsSpectrum ScenariosArchetype-based (e.g. best/worst)Perspective-based (different stakeholder experiences)2×2 or Manoa GridSynthesized from multilayered Spectrum ScenesAim for distinct storiesAllow coexistence and conflict between scenariosEmphasize system-level futuresInclude lived, emotional, and symbolic dimensionsSingle lens or narrative per futureMulti-voiced: scenarios contain inner contradictionsHow It Works in PracticeOrganizations begin by identifying key uncertainties, trust in AI, geopolitical realignments, and data autonomy, and mapping them across spectrums, not binary opposites. These drivers are then embedded into SLA-powered Spectrum Scenes. From these scenes, teams synthesize plural Spectrum Scenarios that reflect differing levels of disruption, adoption, identity alignment, and strategic challenge. Each scenario doesn’t just describe a world; it invites stakeholders to emotionally inhabit it, question their assumptions, and prototype resilient strategies in response.How to Apply ItSpectrum Scenario Design isn’t just a thought experiment; it’s a practical tool set that organizations are already using to rethink strategy, stress-test innovation, and reimagine risk.Here’s how to begin putting it into practice:Start with Spectrum Scenes: Choose a strategic domain, such as trust in AI, climate migration, or workforce automation, and build 4–6 potential future moments in your business using the Spectrum Layer Analysis framework. Don’t aim for consensus. Aim for divergence.Scan the seven layers: Analyze not just the surface trends, but the deep drivers: Who holds power? What beliefs shape resistance or adoption? What metaphors are unconsciously driving behavior?Synthesize multiple perspectives: Group your Spectrum Scenes into 3–5 full scenarios. Each should represent a lived future experience, not an abstract trend line. Ask: Who thrives in this world? Who doesn’t?Prototype the future: Bring each scenario to life with tangible artifacts, such as mock headlines, speculative product ads, or user journey maps. These tools help stakeholders feel the future, not just imagine it.Pressure-test your strategy: Now ask the hard questions. What breaks in this future? What thrives? Where are you resilient, and where are you exposed?Spectrum Scenario Design is not a onetime exercise; it’s a mindset shift. A capability. A practice that builds organizational agility, not by narrowing focus, but by expanding awareness. In a world where change is nonlinear, emotional, and layered, this is how tomorrow’s leaders build foresight that aligns the future.Scenarios in practiceA midsized health tech company specializing in AI-powered diagnostics found itself on the edge of profound disruption. Regulatory regimes were shifting. Public trust in AI was eroding. Traditional strategy tools weren’t keeping up. The company’s existing scenarios failed to anticipate that patients would begin withholding deeply personal data from diagnostic systems. Nor had they accounted for the convergence of conflicting global regulations, or the outright cultural rejection of AI health tech in conservative regions.To better navigate this complexity, the company adopted Spectrum Scenario Planning, beginning with a foundational phase of Spectrum Scenes. The team generated scenes across domains: one spotlighted AI backlash in North America; another imagined spiritual resistance to synthetic diagnostics in Southeast Asia; a third depicted radical health data sovereignty movements in the EU. Each Spectrum Scene captured not just what might happen, but how it might feel, whom it might benefit, or leave behind.Next, the team synthesized these scenes into five Spectrum Scenarios, exploring what it would mean to leverage the SuperShift “BioNexus” from the book, SuperShifts. These futures ranged from:The decentralization of healthcare into local, AI-supported cooperativesTo global frameworks for ethical AI certificationTo geopolitical blocs forming competing standards for biotech governanceEach scenario reflected the different experiences of various stakeholders, including patients, regulators, engineers, and investors; each was analyzed to identify emotional tensions, power dynamics, and system-level risks.To activate strategic imagination, the team created fictional news stories, speculative product packaging, and even AI ethics training modules from imagined futures. These tools allowed executives and stakeholders to connect with the worlds they might soon inhabit emotionally. Finally, the team ran premortems on each scenario, identifying strategic blind spots and stress-testing assumptions.The result? A strategic transformation.The company created a volatility-ready innovation road map, formed alliances based not just on tech compatibility but on shared values, and reoriented its go-to-market strategy toward emergent belief systems around health, autonomy, and trust.They didn’t just future-proof their road map. They learned to future-make.From Future-Proofing to Future-MakingWe cannot predict the future. But we can prepare ourselves to see it more clearly and design for it more confidently.The truth is: traditional scenario planning isn’t broken. It’s just out of breath. In a world of cascading shifts and competing truths, quadrant models are too shallow and too singular. They flatten what should be felt.The next disruption won’t fit inside a box. It will emerge from a cultural ripple, a shift in trust, or a story we didn’t yet know we were telling ourselves.Scenario planning is dead.

2025-07-01 12:05:00,"The Bond Canary In The ""Big Beautiful"" Coal Mine","The Bond Canary In The ""Big Beautiful"" Coal Mine Submitted by QTR's Fringe FinanceWith the passage of President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”—a sprawling new fiscal stimulus and infrastructure package—the U.S. bond market should be in the spotlight, if you ask me.This legislation, which mostly accelerates deficit spending at a time when debt servicing costs are already surging, is colliding with a Treasury market that has shown persistent signs of instability over the past year. Investors should be watching this space very closely.Libertarians and fiscal conservatives are sharply critical of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” arguing it fuels runaway spending, expands government power, and deepens the national debt without accountability. They see it as the latest bipartisan failure to exercise fiscal discipline, especially given the total disregard for the debt ceiling and the growing risk of fiscal dominance, where the Fed is pressured to keep rates low to finance government borrowing.Critics warn that the bill crowds out private investment, distorts markets, and sets the stage for inflation and long-term instability—betraying principles of limited government and economic freedom in favor of politically driven, debt-funded expansion.Meanwhile, over the past six months, the U.S. Treasury market has shown mounting signs of stress, reflecting a growing disconnect between fiscal policy and investor confidence.Multiple long-duration bond auctions have seen weak demand, with bid-to-cover ratios falling and yields coming in higher than expected, indicating that buyers are becoming more reluctant to absorb the government’s growing debt load. Despite market expectations for Fed rate cuts, long-term yields have remained stubbornly high or even risen, suggesting that concerns over inflation and deficit spending are outweighing hopes for monetary easing.The yield curve, which had been deeply inverted, has begun to steepen—not because of optimism, but due to long yields drifting higher, a hallmark of market anxiety over long-term fiscal sustainability. Volatility in the bond market, as captured by the MOVE Index, has remained elevated, while foreign demand from major holders like China and Japan has continued to decline, shifting the burden of new issuance onto domestic buyers.Liquidity in the secondary Treasury market has also deteriorated at times, with widened bid-ask spreads and reduced depth, especially during periods of heavy supply. Primary dealers have reported strain in absorbing growing issuance without central bank support, leading to a visible increase in term premiums. These term premiums have surged as investors demand greater compensation for holding long-dated Treasuries, reflecting concerns about both inflation control and the long-term credibility of U.S. fiscal policy.Adding to this is a breakdown in typical market correlations, with stocks and bonds occasionally falling in tandem—undermining Treasuries’ role as a portfolio hedge.Finally, there’s been a notable shift in investor preference toward shorter-duration instruments like T-bills, signaling widespread reluctance to take on long-term interest rate and inflation risk in today’s uncertain environment.🔥 JULY 4 SALE - 50% OFF FOR LIFE: Using this coupon entitles you to 50% off an annual subscription to Fringe Finance for life: Get 50% off foreverThe Federal Reserve may have maintained its benchmark policy rate within the 4.25%–4.50% range, but bond yields have refused to cooperate with the narrative of a gentle economic landing or a disinflationary environment.The 10-year Treasury yield recently climbed to around 4.60%, while the 30-year surged past 5.08%—levels not seen since late 2023. These moves have come despite a more dovish tone from the Fed and growing market expectations for rate cuts. In other words, long-term yields are drifting higher even as short-term rates are poised to decline—a textbook signal that something is broken in the transmission mechanism between monetary policy and financial markets.One of the clearest illustrations of this disconnect has been recent bond auctions. On May 21, 2025, the U.S. Treasury’s 20-year bond auction drew some of the weakest demand seen in over a year. The auction yielded 5.05%, but immediately afterward, yields shot higher to 5.13%. This wasn't just an anomaly. A month later, the 30-year bond auction on June 12 raised $22 billion at a yield of about 4.844%, with only lukewarm investor interest. Foreign participation remained soft, and domestic buyers appeared cautious.The message appears to be clear: as Treasury issuance ramps up to fund new government spending, buyers are demanding more compensation—or simply not showing up.This dynamic is fueling a growing sense that the U.S. is entering a regime of fiscal dominance—a condition where monetary policy becomes increasingly constrained by the government’s need to finance itself cheaply.In the past, the Federal Reserve could raise or lower rates based purely on its dual mandate of inflation and employment. Today, that independence is being tested. With deficits projected to exceed $2 trillion annually even before Trump’s bill takes full effect, and interest costs threatening to consume a dangerous share of federal revenues, the Fed may find itself boxed in. It’s easy to imagine a scenario where bond yields spike further, financial conditions tighten, and the Fed is pressured to step in—not to fight inflation, but to ensure the government can keep borrowing.These stresses are not limited to a wonky corner of the market. They impact every portfolio. Elevated yields hurt the value of existing bonds, while eroding the relative safety and utility of traditional fixed-income allocations. Worse, if the Fed is eventually forced to resume quantitative easing or suppress long-term yields artificially, it could reignite inflationary pressures—just as policymakers are trying to declare victory on price stability.This is why I continue to favor tangible, finite assets that are insulated from political interference and monetary distortion. Gold and silver remain essential hedges against inflation and systemic risk. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized architecture, represents a digital alternative to fiat currencies increasingly weighed down by sovereign overreach. Real assets—including productive land, select commodities, and certain types of real estate—offer intrinsic value that isn’t easily diluted.What we’re seeing now is a market in transition. The old model—where the Fed could engineer soft landings and the Treasury market would quietly absorb endless supply—is breaking down.With bond yields rising in defiance of Fed policy, auctions repeatedly falling flat, and deficits spiraling higher, investors can no longer afford to treat U.S. debt as the unquestioned “safe asset.”The passage of Trump’s new spending bill makes this a critical moment to watch the bond market closely. If yields continue climbing or auctions deteriorate further, it may signal that the market is rejecting the premise of unlimited fiscal expansion—and that the Treasury market is no longer functioning normally.Now read:FDA Exposed: Hundreds of Drugs Approved Without Proof They Work""Seize The Means Of Production"": Mamdani Lays Bare His AgendaCritics Of Capitalism Misunderstand Economic SuccessPowell: No Pivot, No PartyHey Dems: Unseat Mamdani And You’ll Win The 2028 NationalBeware Of When The Smoke Clears3 Misconceptions About US Debt: Lyn AldenQTR’s Disclaimer: Please read my full legal disclaimer on my About page here.

2025-07-01 12:00:00,Radius Recycling Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results,"Significant Improvements Sequentially and Year-Over-YearHigher Ferrous, Nonferrous and Finished Steel Sales VolumesRadius Board Declares Quarterly DividendPORTLAND, Ore., July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radius Recycling, Inc. (NASDAQ:RDUS) (""Radius"" or the ""Company"") today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 ended May 31, 2025.The Company reported a loss per share from continuing operations of $(0.59) and a net loss of $(16) million in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a significant improvement compared to ($1.15) and ($33) million, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025.Adjusted EBITDA was $22 million in the third quarter, a significant improvement from approximately break-even in the prior quarter. Adjusted loss per share from continuing operations was $(0.39) in the third quarter, compared to ($0.99) in the second quarter.The biggest drivers of the sequential performance improvement were significantly higher sales volumes for all the Company's products, stronger nonferrous and finished steel market conditions and prices, and higher auto parts retail sales.Nonferrous demand was strong in the third quarter, especially in the domestic market, driving average net selling prices up 7% sequentially. Nonferrous sales volumes increased 23%, supported by seasonally higher supply flows and higher yields from the Company's metal recovery technology investments.Ferrous sales volumes were 4% higher sequentially, primarily driven by seasonality on supply flows. In a particularly volatile market environment, ferrous average net selling prices were 3% higher sequentially. Domestically, ferrous demand and prices rose in March on mill restocking activity, before decreasing significantly in the remainder of the quarter on macroeconomic uncertainty. Export ferrous market conditions were weaker, as demand was impacted by increased levels of Chinese semi-finished and finished steel exports, compounded by the uncertain macroeconomic environment. The impact of average inventory accounting was approximately neutral in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, similar to the previous quarter.Finished steel sales volumes increased 15% sequentially, driven primarily by seasonally stronger construction activity amid continued healthy demand in the Company's Western markets. Rolling mill utilization reached 107%, significantly higher than 88% in the prior quarter, which contributed to improved operating leverage and a sequential expansion in margins. Finished steel average net selling prices increased 4% sequentially.In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company generated positive operating cash flow of $3 million. Total debt was $454 million at the end of the quarter, and debt, net of cash, was $438 million. Capital expenditures were $10 million in the quarter.The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was a benefit of 2% on a pre-tax loss, primarily a reflection of the Company's valuation allowance position.During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company returned capital to shareholders through its 125th consecutive quarterly dividend.Declaration of Quarterly DividendThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.1875 per common share, payable August 4, 2025 to shareholders of record on July 21, 2025. The Company has paid a dividend every quarter since going public in November 1993.Pending MergerAs previously announced, on March 13, 2025, the Company, Toyota Tsusho America, Inc. (""TAI""), and TAI Merger Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TAI (""Merger Sub""), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the ""Merger""), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TAI.As previously announced, on June 5, 2025, the Company held a special meeting of shareholders, at which the Company's shareholders approved the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, the parties to the Merger Agreement expect the Merger to close during the second half of calendar year 2025.Subsequent EventAs previously reported, on June 20, 2025, the Company and its lenders executed an amendment to the Company's existing credit agreement, which among other things, reduces the aggregate amount of revolving commitments available from $800 million to $625 million, and provides for certain other modifications.Earnings Conference CallAs a result of the pending Merger with TAI, the Company will not be holding a third quarter earnings conference call or webcast.About Radius Recycling, Inc.Radius is a leading North American recycler of ferrous and nonferrous metals with 53 operating facilities across 25 states, Puerto Rico, and Western Canada.

2025-07-01 12:00:00,Condo Prices Dropped 2% in May—the Second Largest Decline on Record,"Redfin reports condo prices fell amid increasing HOA fees and insurance costs, while single-family home prices rose 0.5%(NASDAQ:RDFN) — The median U.S. condo sale price fell 2.2% year over year to $354,100 in May—the second largest drop in records dating back to 2012. That's according to a new report from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage.The only time condo prices posted a larger year-over-year decline was in April 2023 (-2.9%), and that was largely because roughly one year prior, prices peaked (this was true across all property types).Today, condo prices are falling because there are roughly 80% more condo sellers than buyers in the market. Many condo owners are trying to offload their properties because HOA fees and insurance costs have been soaring, and some homeowners' associations are doling out hefty special assessments. Many house hunters are hesitant to purchase a condo for the same reasons.""It's a slow housing market across the board, but condos have been hit particularly hard,"" said Aditi Jain, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in the Boston area. ""A lot of condo associations don't allow buyers with FHA loans, which is limiting sales. Two of my clients who want to buy a condo have had to back out of a purchase because they couldn't get financing.""The U.S. single-family home market is cooling, but not as rapidly as the condo market; the median sale price of single-family homes rose 0.5% year over year in May to $462,206. That's the slowest growth in nearly two years—but it's still growth.Condo Sales Drop 12% as Many Properties Linger on the MarketSales of condos fell 11.9% year over year in May. That's the largest decline since June 2024 and is over three times larger than the drop in single-family-home sales (-3.7%).

2025-07-01 11:00:00,The most undervalued asset for a leader? It’s these 2 hours,"By the time most leaders sit down at their desks, they’ve already spent a chunk of their best energy. They’ve triaged emails, squeezed in early meetings, and handled “just one quick thing” that ballooned into an hour. It’s barely 10 a.m. and their attention is already diluted, their decision-making fatigued.In my work as an executive leadership coach, I see every day what the studies have been showing us for years. Our brain’s capacity to make good decisions depletes as the day progresses.The sheer volume of decisions we have to make each day is leaving us diminished. And our days get hijacked by email—with us losing almost a full day’s worth every week.The compounding effect of this is that leaders are less sharp, more reactive, and prone to default decisions rather than breakthroughs. So what if, instead of reacting, we reserved that early window for something more valuable?The first two hours of your workday aren’t just another block on the calendar. They’re your cognitive prime. The time when your brain is sharpest and your energy most aligned with creative, focused work. They’re also the time most leaders give away too easily. Reclaiming it is about making a deliberate leadership move that pays off in clarity, influence, and impact.The cost of default morningsMost of us don’t design our mornings: we inherit them. Calendars fill with recurring meetings, habitual inbox checks, and requests from others. We hit the ground running, but often in the wrong direction.This default mode comes at a price. While research shows we have peak cognitive capacity in the morning, that prime time is too often squandered on low-impact tasks. It’s like hiring a Michelin-star chef to butter toast.In the end, leaders end up firefighting all day, making decisions from a place of fatigue, and pushing their most strategic thinking to a time when their brain is already checked out.The first two hours as a leadership leverReclaiming your first two hours isn’t about working harder or even smarter, it’s about working sharper.Working smarter is about efficiency. It’s finding faster ways to do familiar things, streamlining systems, and ticking more off your list in less time. That’s helpful, but it still treats all hours of the day as equal.Working sharper is different. It respects the natural rhythm of your body and brain. It’s not just about what you’re doing, but when you’re doing it.Your cognitive capacity peaks in the first few hours after waking. This is when your brain is most alert, creative, and capable of solving complex problems. Sharper work means aligning your most important thinking with your highest mental performance.Leaders who intentionally front-load their day with deep, high-impact work don’t just get more done; they make better decisions, model smarter working habits, and lead with more clarity. They create time to think, not just to respond—and that’s the game changer.When your first hours are spent solving complex problems, crafting strategy, or preparing for high-stakes conversations, you’re not just ticking off tasks, but setting the tone for how your team operates and how your business grows.Small changes, outsized impactWhen leaders begin to guard their early hours, the ripple effect is striking. Teams notice, the culture shifts, and people get braver about protecting their own energy.I’ve worked with senior leaders who transformed their team’s operating rhythm just by removing early meetings and declaring the first two hours as thinking time. It signalled a new standard: that considered work matters more than constant busyness. That energy is a finite resource worth protecting.And yes, it requires a shift. You may need to renegotiate habits with your team, push back on automatic scheduling tools, or educate others about your new working rhythm. But leadership is, in part, about setting boundaries that enable your best work and empower others to do the same.Rethinking what belongs in the morningTo make the most of your best energy, you need to protect it. Here’s how:Block, don’t hope. Set a recurring two-hour block in the morning for proactive work. Don’t leave it to chance.Start with friction. Tackle the task you’re most likely to procrastinate; your brain is most equipped to handle it now.Email can wait. Unless you’re in customer service, few emails need a response at 8 a.m. Turn off notifications and don’t open your inbox until after your deep work is done.Delay the meetings. Push back recurring stand-ups or updates to later in the day where possible. Mornings should be reserved for creation, not coordination.Even reclaiming just one morning a week can create meaningful shifts in how you lead and perform.What your calendar says about your leadershipThere’s a simple way to tell what you value most as a leader. Look at your calendar.If the first two hours of each day are filled with admin and reactivity, it’s worth asking: what are you giving away? And what would change if you claimed that space instead?Reclaiming this time is a move toward leading with more foresight and less fatigue. It’s a signal to your team that thoughtfulness trumps frenzy.And it starts tomorrow morning. Just two hours for your clearest thinking, and the work that truly matters.",fastcompany,https://www.fastcompany.com/91360637/the-most-undervalued-asset-for-a-leader-its-these-2-hours?partner=rss,politics,

The financial statements, management's discussion and analysis (MD&A), and related certifications are available on SEDAR+.The Company also announced that effective June 27, 2025, its principal regulator, the British Columbia Securities Commission (""BCSC""), has revoked its failure to file cease trade order (the ""FFCTO"") that was issued on May 8, 2025. The FFCTO was issued as a result of the Company's delay in filing its audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, the related management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and CEO and CFO certificates relating to the audited annual financial statements as required by National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings (collectively, the ""Required Documents"") beyond the April 30, 2025 filing deadline.The Company has filed the required documents on SEDAR+ and trading will resume on the Canadian Securities Exchange following the dissemination of this news release.Annual Financial ResultsHighlights – Year Ended December 31, 2024In 2024, Pasinex recorded a net loss of approximately $2.7 million compared with a net loss of approximately $0.3 million in 2023. The increased loss primarily reflects lower equity gains from the Horzum AS joint venture, no dividends assigned in 2024, and higher costs incurred.Horzum AS produced 3,601 tonnes of high-grade zinc product in 2024, compared to 8,061 tonnes in 2023, primarily due to decreased mineral reserves and paused exploration activities resulting from ongoing legal disputes.Sales volumes decreased approximately 55% year-over-year to 3,601 tonnes, reflecting lower production levels. Despite lower volume, average sales prices per tonne on a USD basis increased approximately 20% compared to 2023.Cost per tonne mined increased significantly to CAD $985 in 2024, from CAD $601 in 2023, primarily driven by lower tonnes mined resulting in higher relative fixed and step-variable costs per tonne.The USD cash cost per pound of zinc product mined increased to US$0.66 per pound in 2024, up from US$0.44 in 2023, primarily due to lower production volumes, resulting in higher fixed and step-variable costs per pound.The average zinc grade of sold product improved to 51.5% in 2024 from 48.9% in 2023.Operations in Türkiye remain under significant inflationary pressures, with three-years cumulative inflation reaching approximately 291% as of December 31, 2024, impacting overall cost structures.Exploration activities at Pinargozu were significantly reduced due to ongoing legal disputes, with drilling activities decreasing to 6,526 meters from 10,782 meters in 2023.Horzum AS achieved another zero-fatality year at the Pinargozu Mine, logging 99,752 fatality-free hours and reporting reductions in both serious and lost-time injuries compared to 2023.Pasinex proactively secured the appointment of an Interim Committee by Turkish courts ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/07/g46216068/pasinex-announces-2024-annual-and-2025-q1-financial-results,business,

Hashrate will continue to increase at the site through the third quarter of 2025 as new mining rigs continue to be delivered in scheduled batches, gradually replacing legacy units. Cipher's total self-mining hashrate has now reached ~16.8 EH/s, and the Company maintains its expectations to scale to ~23.1 EH/s upon completion of the installation.In addition, the Company today released its unaudited production and operations update for June 2025. While the report includes initial contributions from Black Pearl, which started hashing at the end of the month, the production numbers also reflect the Company's strategic decision to curtail more deliberately as part of its proactive 4CP avoidance strategy. This approach allowed the Company to avoid costly 4CP penalties and maintain its position as having some of the lowest power costs in the industry.

(TSXV:IVS) (""Inventus"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has signed a milling agreement with McEwen Mining for the processing of bulk sample material from its 100%-owned Pardo Gold Project, located 65 km northeast of Sudbury, Ontario.HighlightsMilling agreement signed with McEwen MiningBulk Sample extraction from 007 North site progressing on schedule with milling expected in late JulyGrade-control drilling resumes to define the remaining 30,000-tonne of 45,000- tonne bulk sampling programMilling AgreementUnder the newly signed milling agreement with McEwen Mining, Inventus will process bulk sample material from the Pardo Gold Project at McEwen's Stock Mill. Under the agreement the Company can process up to 5,000 tonnes per month, for a total of up to 45,000 tonnes. A 1,000-tonne bulk sample from Pardo was processed at the Stock Mill in 2017 (see news Jan 3, 2018), yielding an average grade of 4.2 gpt gold with an 89% recovery rate. However, based on the Company's previous metallurgical testing, recoveries could be up to 95% under optimized conditions.Bulk Sample UpdateBulk sample extraction at 007 North, targeting 5,000 tonnes, is progressing well with the waste removed and the gold mineralization being blasted and mucked in preparation for crushing and trucking to McEwen's Stock Mill (Figure 1 - 3). Bulk Sample processing of 007 North material is expected to commence in late July with a series of planned bulk samples ongoing into the first half of 2026. The 007 North Bulk Sample is targeting flat-lying gold mineralization within 6 metres of surface that was previously reported to have an average grade and thickness from grade-control drilling of 3.84 gpt gold over 1.82 metres (see news June 4, 2025).Drilling UpdateGrade-control drilling resumed on June 25th to define the remaining 30,000 tonnes of the planned 45,000-tonne bulk sample program, building on the success of the initial phase that defined the first 15,000 tonnes.

(""PyroGenesis"") (http://pyrogenesis.com) (TSX:PYR) (OTCQX:PYRGF) (FRA: 8PY1), a high-tech company that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes advanced all-electric plasma processes and sustainable solutions to support heavy industry in their energy transition, emission reduction, commodity security, and waste remediation efforts, announces that it has signed a contract for €379,000 (approximately CA$600,000) with one of the world's largest integrated environmental services companies, expanding PyroGenesis' relationship with this client to include developing a solution for the plastic waste problem in Europe. The client, whose name is being withheld for competitive and confidentiality reasons, operates more than 100 waste treatment sites and facilities across Europe.Plastic waste is a major issue across Europe, from both a waste and financial penalty perspective. In 2022, in Europe, over 32 million tonnes of plastic waste was generated, with only 27% being recycled. i Eight European member states landfill more than 50% of their plastics waste. iiAs a result, the European Union has imposed significant financial penalties on plastic waste. On January 1, 2021, a levy on non-recycled plastic packaging waste was introduced, where each member state pays €800 for each tonne (€0.80 per kilogram) of non-recycled waste. iii To pay for this levy, individual member states have imposed various measures, including taxes on the manufacturing, importing, and purchase of non-reusable plastic packaging products as high as €0.45 per kilogram (in Italy and Spain). iv On top of these penalties, additional taxes are imposed in some member states on both the incineration and landfilling of waste, of up to €40 per tonne. vToday's announced project is for the engineering and testing of an advanced waste management solution targeting both non-recyclable plastics and other forms of hazardous liquid waste. Using PyroGenesis' high-temperature plasma gasification technology as the platform, the goal is to create an environmentally sustainable waste disposal process with low greenhouse gas emissions.Image 1: Non-recyclable plastic waste in a landfill.""With these financial penalties in mind, European companies are seeking to reduce their plastic waste,"" noted P.

2025-07-02 10:59:07,"Inside America's department stores, tariff-triggered price hikes are picking up","The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal. However, investor optimism was limited due to a new report showing private payrolls surprisingly decreased in June, raising concern over the state of the U.S. economy.The broad market index gained 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 48 points, or 0.1%.The S&P 500 saw a boost after the president posted about the deal between the two countries on Truth Social, though he provided no additional information on the agreement. Shares of Nike, which manufactures about half of its footwear in Vietnam as well as China, were 3% higher after the announcement. Earlier Wednesday, stocks came under some pressure after the latest report by ADP showed that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs last month. That marks the first monthly decline in ADP’s payrolls report since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected payrolls to grow by 100,000.“We, frankly, have been seeing a weakening of the labor market for months and months now, and I always wondered if it would take a negative payrolls print to get the [Federal Reserve] to pay a little bit more attention to the labor market as opposed to the inflation picture,” Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, told CNBC. “This is, on that front, what will hopefully catch some attention.”The report comes with the stock market near record highs despite concerns that lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries could slow U.S. and global economic growth.To be sure, the ADP report has a lackluster record predicting the government’s monthly jobs report, which is due out Thursday. Economists expect growth of 110,000 jobs for June.However, if the upcoming jobs data follows the ADP report in missing expectations, a Fed interest rate cut may be on the table when policymakers meet later this month, according to CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall. There’s already been growing expectations for the Fed lowering rates at its July meeting, as the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows a roughly 25% chance of a cut, up from 20% a day before.“If we end up having a fairly weak employment report, then that could allow the Fed to be cutting rates,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. He also pointed out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently confirmed that the central bank would have cut rates by now if it weren’t for Trump’s tariff plans announced earlier this year.“If that were the case then, it could be the case now, especially if you know we have weaker-than-expected employment data,” Stovall added.Wall Street is coming off a mixed session, with the Dow surging 400 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower after a broad decline in tech shares. The Dow got a boost as investors rotated into materials and health care stocks.Traders were also keeping an eye on Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. The measure returns to the House, where there are still hold-outs among GOP lawmakers.Nike shares jump after U.S.-Vietnam trade deal announcementNike popped more than 2% on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a trade deal between the U.S. and Vietnam. Vietnam is a key manufacturing hub for the athletic footwear and apparel company.Wednesday’s gains puts the stock’s one-week incline at almost 24%. Shares are still marginally lower on the year, however, falling 0.4% year to date.— Sean ConlonNasdaq rises to session high after Trump says U.S. reached trade deal with VietnamThe Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 rose after President Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he “made a Trade Deal with Vietnam.” He added that details will follow at a later time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reached its high of the day and was last up 0.7%. The S&P 500 gained 0.2%. Tech stocks Nvidia and Apple also caught a bid after the post.— Fred ImbertRoss Stores upgraded at JefferiesJefferies upgraded Ross Stores to buy from hold Tuesday, citing the stock’s wide valuation gap to its peers and the opportunity for margin improvement. The firm also raised its price target to $150 from $135, implying more than 15% upside from Monday’s close.“We view ROST as well positioned to outperform as comps should accelerate through YE (easy compares, support from ladies’ apparel improvement, refinement of better & best brands),” analyst Corey Tarlowe said in a note.He believes Ross Stores can return to earnings before interest and taxes expansion next year, despite potential tariff headwinds.The stock was up nearly 2% in premarket trading. It has lost 14% year to date.— Michelle FoxStocks open in the redStocks traded down on Wednesday morning.The S&P 500 dropped 0.1% shortly after 9:30 a.m. ET, as did the Nasdaq Composite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 28 points, or 0.1%.— Sean ConlonTesla rallies 5% in premarket after second-quarter vehicle deliveries exceed expectationsShares of Tesla jumped 5% in Wednesday’s premarket trading hours, after the electric vehicle maker reported second-quarter vehicle delivery numbers that were better than investors had feared.During the period, Tesla delivered 384,000 vehicles. This marked a 14% year-over-year decline and also came under the 387,000 deliveries analysts had expected, according to FactSet.It was also Tesla’s second quarterly drop in a row.— Lisa Kailai HanBank stocks, Rigetti Computing, Centene among stocks moving in premarket tradingCheck out the companies making headlines before the bell.JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup — Major bank stocks rose less than 1% after the firms said they plan to hike dividends after receiving stress test results from the Federal Reserve. JPMorgan also announced a new stock buyback program.Rigetti Computing — Shares gained nearly 2% after Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of the quantum computing company with an overweight rating, and a $15 price target implying more than 30% upside from Tuesday’s close. Analyst Troy Jensen said: “Quantum computing is in its infancy but remains one of the most highly coveted technical milestones with enormous economical implications. While we are likely years away from full-scale quantum capabilities, the technology has already captured the interest of investors.”Centene — Shares of the managed care giant plummeted 30% after Centene withdrew its 2025 guidance, saying that recent data the company received shows lower enrollment rates in health insurance marketplaces in several states.

Job growth in May was also downwardly revised to 29,000.— Sean ConlonMajor banks hike dividends following Fed stress testsMajor bank stocks were poised to open higher on Wednesday after the firms announced they would be returning more capital to shareholders following the Federal Reserve’s stress tests. JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja said in a note to clients that the dividend increases for stress test banks as a whole were “higher than expected.” Here are some of the changes from the biggest firms:JPMorgan Chase — Hiking dividend to $1.50 per share from $1.40 previously and authorizing a $50 billion stock buyback programBank of America — Hiking dividend to 28 cents per share from 26 centsWells Fargo — Hiking dividend to 45 cents per share from 40 centsGoldman Sachs — Hiking dividend to $4.00 per share from $3.00Citigroup — Hiking dividend to 60 cents per share from 56 cents.— Jesse PoundTesla rises after Monday’s sell-offDavid Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA Tesla dealership in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, July 1, 2025.

The broad market index has been on a big run – and additional gains may be ahead, according to a key technical pattern.The S&P 500 formed a “golden cross” on Tuesday, which is when its 50-day moving average crosses above a rising 200-day moving average. Traders view this as a bullish signal for momentum. The last time the broad market index formed a golden cross was in July 2020 as stocks were recovering from the pandemic-induced sell-off.History suggests that further gains could be around the corner: The S&P 500 has risen on a six-month basis following the past 11 golden crosses. The index has also advanced on a three-month basis after the past nine golden crosses.However, there are exceptions: After the S&P 500 formed a golden cross in May 1990, it dropped 12% over the next 12 months. The benchmark also formed a golden cross in April 2019, with the index sliding nearly a year later in the throes of the Covid sell-off.—Nick Wells, Darla MercadoShort sellers have lost a combined $300 billion since the April lows, S3 Partners says Short sellers have lost $300 billion or 22% since the stock market bottom on April 8, according to S3 Partners, a researcher that specializes in tracking short selling.Over the same time, the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 indexes have each risen 24% while the Nasdaq Composite is higher by 33%, S3 said.Eben with the the latest losses, short interest is still up by $139 billion, or 10.5%, in 2025, according to figures from Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s head of predictive analytics.

2025-07-02 11:00:25,Trump immigration crackdown ripples through economy,"Data: Oxford Economics/Cato Institute/Deportation Data Project/CBO/DHS/TRAC. Chart: Axios VisualsPresident Trump's immigration crackdown is hitting key pockets of the economy, disrupting workplaces and communities around the country.Why it matters: The sharp fall in immigration this year threatens to slow down economic growth, particularly in the sectors and cities that relied on newcomers to the U.S. in recent years.What they're saying: With the push against immigration, ""the economy will find itself slightly diminished in the long run and inflation will run a touch higher,"" economist Bernard Yaros writes in a report for Oxford Economics.There will be fewer workers to produce goods and services, slowing down growth and putting pressure on wages.By the numbers: Net immigration started to fall last summer after the Biden administration took a harder line. This year, Trump's crackdown has been far more aggressive.Net immigration — inflows of people minus outflows — is running at an annualized rate of 600,000, down about a third from where it was in the last three months of 2024, per the analysis by Oxford Economics, which looks at several sources of public data.The decline is almost entirely due to a sharp drop in unauthorized immigration. Border crossings are stalled, and deportations are up.What to watch: Yaros estimates in the long run, GDP will be 0.25% lower as a result.That's a relatively modest macroeconomic effect, but there's a wild card. The ""big, beautiful bill"" that passed the Senate contains about $175 billion for even more immigration enforcement.That could mean an even bigger decline going forward.Between the lines: Immigration's effects on the economy are a slow burn, and it'll take a while before it shows up in the macro data.For now they are rippling through industries that rely on immigrant workers, like farms, hotels, construction and meatpacking plants.Zoom in: Smaller cities are feeling the hit from deportations and ICE raids, places like St. Louis, Buffalo and Pittsburgh where immigration had boosted faltering economies, the Wall Street Journal reports.""The arrests cast a shadow over the local economy. Restaurant tables emptied. Kitchen workers stayed home. Fruit vendors disappeared from the streets. The number of shoppers at stores shrank, and those who still went didn't linger for long,"" the paper writes.The nation's farms are in a tough spot, too, and employees are fearful of showing up to work.""That means crops are not being picked and fruit and vegetables are rotting at peak harvest time,"" farmers and farmworkers told Reuters.ICE is also going through carwashes, construction sites and meatpacking plants, the Washington Post reports.In Los Angeles, immigration raids are slowing down the rebuilding efforts from the devastating fires earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times reports.Even the horse racing industry is sweating the crackdown. ""Scary times,"" a Louisville racehorse trainer tells a local news station about ICE raids.Yes, but: Immigration opponents say the crackdown will translate into more and better-paying jobs for native-born Americans.The bottom line: Until recently, a surge in immigration drove solid economic growth and a robust labor market. Now, policy is pushing it the other way.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/02/trump-immigration-crackdown-economy,politics,

2025-07-02 10:48:23,"Artificial intelligence: Saving you money, and helping MassDOT build faster","The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal. However, investor optimism was limited due to a new report showing private payrolls surprisingly decreased in June, raising concern over the state of the U.S. economy.The broad market index gained 0.47% and had scored a fresh all-time intraday high during the session. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.94%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded just below the flatline.The S&P 500 saw a boost after Trump posted on Truth Social about the deal between the U.S. and Vietnam. The deal includes a 20% tariff on imports from Vietnam. Shares of Nike, which manufactures approximately half of its footwear in Vietnam as well as China, were also 4% higher after the announcement.Earlier Wednesday, stocks came under some pressure after the latest report by ADP showed that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs last month. That marks the first monthly decline in ADP’s payrolls report since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected payrolls to grow by 100,000.“We, frankly, have been seeing a weakening of the labor market for months and months now, and I always wondered if it would take a negative payrolls print to get the [Federal Reserve] to pay a little bit more attention to the labor market as opposed to the inflation picture,” Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, told CNBC. “This is, on that front, what will hopefully catch some attention.”To be sure, the ADP report has a lackluster record predicting the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is due out Thursday. Economists expect growth of 110,000 jobs for June.However, if the upcoming jobs data follows the ADP report in missing expectations, a Fed interest rate cut may be on the table when policymakers meet later this month, according to CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall. There’s already been growing expectations for the Fed lowering rates at its July meeting, as the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows a roughly 23% chance of a cut, up from almost 21% a day before.“If we end up having a fairly weak employment report, then that could allow the Fed to be cutting rates,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. He also pointed out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently confirmed that the central bank would have cut rates by now if it weren’t for Trump’s tariff plans announced earlier this year.“If that were the case then, it could be the case now, especially if we have weaker-than-expected employment data,” Stovall added.Traders were also keeping an eye on Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. The measure returns to the House, where there are still hold-outs among GOP lawmakers.There’s ‘some kind of reckoning to come’ for the market, portfolio manager says Markets have largely ignored some signs that the U.S. economy could cracking over more front-and-center concerns tied to tariffs, according to Rational Dynamic Brands Fund portfolio manager Eric Clark. Once clarity on tariffs comes, he said, markets could then turn to the uncomfortable data and a potentially slowing job market.“Through the trees it’s clear that lower growth because of higher U.S. debt and demographics and higher inflation is going to be the outcome,” Clark told CNBC. “So the market will start looking at that and more closely scrutinizing multiples...there’s definitely some kind of reckoning to come”— Brian EvansEuropean equities are poised for a breakout to new highsThe setup for European equities looks attractive now that the S&P 500 has once again returned to all-time highs, according to Barclays.Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, said the STOXX Europe 600 could soon break out to new highs. He thinks the index could end the year at 570, implying more than 5% upside for the index. The index is up 6.7% year to date.“We think equities will most likely continue to climb the wall of worry in H2,” Cau wrote Wednesday in a note with the title, “Breakout in the waiting.” “Overall, no plain sailing but we think this should help Stoxx 600 break out to new highs and reach 570 by year-end, led by rotation into ytd laggards/tariff losers/exporters as Momentum looks stretched.”Of course, the index, which has been rangebound since February, has a number of challenges ahead of it, including ongoing tariff uncertainty and any fallout from the massive U.S. federal spending bill. But Cau said the risk/return profile is more attractive, now that uncertainty has likely peaked. A lower bar to clear for earnings and an accommodative central bank should also help European stocks. — Sarah MinADP report showed ‘meaningful’ job losses in small businesses, Baird’s Ross Mayfield saysBrandon Bell | Getty ImagesA hiring sign is displayed in an Auto Zone store window on June 25, 2025 in Austin, Texas. The latest ADP payrolls report was bad news for small businesses, according to Ross Mayfield of Baird.The report, which showed a loss of 33,000 jobs in June, revealed that businesses with less than 20 employees saw a net loss of 29,000 jobs. Businesses with more than 500 employees tallied a 30,000 increase in payrolls, however.“A lot of the job loss was concentrated in small business, which is maybe not surprising given the given the economic backdrop, but I think it’s meaningful given just how many people are employed by small and private businesses,” the investment strategist said. “We focus so much on the stock market, but that’s the primary driver of employment in this country, so not ideal to see small businesses shutting jobs like that.”— Sean ConlonCentene tracks for worst day in its history after pulling guidanceCentene shares headed for their worst day on record after the health care company pulled its full-year guidance.The company announced Tuesday afternoon that it was withdrawing its previously announced outlook for GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2025.

It’s gained more than 1,000% since the announcement. Betting platform SharpLink Gaming, which has also initiated an ETH treasury strategy, added more than 16%. Bit Digital, which last week exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans, jumped 6%.On Tuesday, as bitcoin ETFs snapped a 15-day streak of inflows, ether ETFs saw $40 million in inflows led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. ETH ETFs came back to life in June after much concern they were becoming zombie funds.The price of the coin itself was last higher by 6%. It’s been struggling with an identity crisis fueled by uncertainty about Ethereum’s value proposition and weaker revenue since its last big technical upgrade and increasing competition from Solana. Market volatility driven by geopolitical uncertainty this year has not helped. Ether is down 23% this year.For more read the full story here.— Tanaya MacheelRobinhood, Tesla among the names making moves middayCheck out the stocks making big midday moves Wednesday:Robinhood — The brokerage stock climbed 7% as traders speculated that it could soon be added to the S&P 500.

2025-07-02 10:41:03,Man charged in deadly Brockton stabbing pleads not guilty,"The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal. However, investor optimism was limited due to a new report showing private payrolls surprisingly decreased in June, raising concern over the state of the U.S. economy.The broad market index gained 0.47% and had scored a fresh all-time intraday high during the session. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.94%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded just below the flatline.The S&P 500 saw a boost after Trump posted on Truth Social about the deal between the U.S. and Vietnam. The deal includes a 20% tariff on imports from Vietnam. Shares of Nike, which manufactures approximately half of its footwear in Vietnam as well as China, were also 4% higher after the announcement.Earlier Wednesday, stocks came under some pressure after the latest report by ADP showed that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs last month. That marks the first monthly decline in ADP’s payrolls report since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected payrolls to grow by 100,000.“We, frankly, have been seeing a weakening of the labor market for months and months now, and I always wondered if it would take a negative payrolls print to get the [Federal Reserve] to pay a little bit more attention to the labor market as opposed to the inflation picture,” Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, told CNBC. “This is, on that front, what will hopefully catch some attention.”To be sure, the ADP report has a lackluster record predicting the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is due out Thursday. Economists expect growth of 110,000 jobs for June.However, if the upcoming jobs data follows the ADP report in missing expectations, a Fed interest rate cut may be on the table when policymakers meet later this month, according to CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall. There’s already been growing expectations for the Fed lowering rates at its July meeting, as the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows a roughly 23% chance of a cut, up from almost 21% a day before.“If we end up having a fairly weak employment report, then that could allow the Fed to be cutting rates,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. He also pointed out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently confirmed that the central bank would have cut rates by now if it weren’t for Trump’s tariff plans announced earlier this year.“If that were the case then, it could be the case now, especially if we have weaker-than-expected employment data,” Stovall added.Traders were also keeping an eye on Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. The measure returns to the House, where there are still hold-outs among GOP lawmakers.There’s ‘some kind of reckoning to come’ for the market, portfolio manager says Markets have largely ignored some signs that the U.S. economy could cracking over more front-and-center concerns tied to tariffs, according to Rational Dynamic Brands Fund portfolio manager Eric Clark. Once clarity on tariffs comes, he said, markets could then turn to the uncomfortable data and a potentially slowing job market.“Through the trees it’s clear that lower growth because of higher U.S. debt and demographics and higher inflation is going to be the outcome,” Clark told CNBC. “So the market will start looking at that and more closely scrutinizing multiples...there’s definitely some kind of reckoning to come”— Brian EvansEuropean equities are poised for a breakout to new highsThe setup for European equities looks attractive now that the S&P 500 has once again returned to all-time highs, according to Barclays.Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, said the STOXX Europe 600 could soon break out to new highs. He thinks the index could end the year at 570, implying more than 5% upside for the index. The index is up 6.7% year to date.“We think equities will most likely continue to climb the wall of worry in H2,” Cau wrote Wednesday in a note with the title, “Breakout in the waiting.” “Overall, no plain sailing but we think this should help Stoxx 600 break out to new highs and reach 570 by year-end, led by rotation into ytd laggards/tariff losers/exporters as Momentum looks stretched.”Of course, the index, which has been rangebound since February, has a number of challenges ahead of it, including ongoing tariff uncertainty and any fallout from the massive U.S. federal spending bill. But Cau said the risk/return profile is more attractive, now that uncertainty has likely peaked. A lower bar to clear for earnings and an accommodative central bank should also help European stocks. — Sarah MinADP report showed ‘meaningful’ job losses in small businesses, Baird’s Ross Mayfield saysBrandon Bell | Getty ImagesA hiring sign is displayed in an Auto Zone store window on June 25, 2025 in Austin, Texas. The latest ADP payrolls report was bad news for small businesses, according to Ross Mayfield of Baird.The report, which showed a loss of 33,000 jobs in June, revealed that businesses with less than 20 employees saw a net loss of 29,000 jobs. Businesses with more than 500 employees tallied a 30,000 increase in payrolls, however.“A lot of the job loss was concentrated in small business, which is maybe not surprising given the given the economic backdrop, but I think it’s meaningful given just how many people are employed by small and private businesses,” the investment strategist said. “We focus so much on the stock market, but that’s the primary driver of employment in this country, so not ideal to see small businesses shutting jobs like that.”— Sean ConlonCentene tracks for worst day in its history after pulling guidanceCentene shares headed for their worst day on record after the health care company pulled its full-year guidance.The company announced Tuesday afternoon that it was withdrawing its previously announced outlook for GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2025.

It’s gained more than 1,000% since the announcement. Betting platform SharpLink Gaming, which has also initiated an ETH treasury strategy, added more than 16%. Bit Digital, which last week exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans, jumped 6%.On Tuesday, as bitcoin ETFs snapped a 15-day streak of inflows, ether ETFs saw $40 million in inflows led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. ETH ETFs came back to life in June after much concern they were becoming zombie funds.The price of the coin itself was last higher by 6%. It’s been struggling with an identity crisis fueled by uncertainty about Ethereum’s value proposition and weaker revenue since its last big technical upgrade and increasing competition from Solana. Market volatility driven by geopolitical uncertainty this year has not helped.

2025-07-02 10:38:00,"Gen Z is the worst at work, right? Wrong","If we took everything at face value, today’s media headlines, studies, and overall assumptions about the next generation currently entering the workforce could be considered true. Unreliable. Entitled. Difficult to work with. Zero work ethic. Screen-obsessed, except on Zoom calls because their cameras are always off. Unwilling to work in the office or collaborate with others.These are just a few of the stereotypes overshadowing Gen Z, the youngest generation in the workforce and, apparently, the bane of business leaders around the world.Personal ExperienceThey also remind me of what I personally experienced when I started my professional career in the late 2000s.My first professional opportunities were often marked by generational biases and unintentional leaders who made it more difficult to grow my skills and gain the experiences necessary to mature as a leader. I was told I didn’t “look like a leader” and that I looked “more like a celebrity or influencer than a traditional businessperson,” which is both inappropriate and unhelpful.It’s also a bad reason to decline to provide the proper coaching or professional development opportunities that would have helped young professionals like me thrive.As a millennial and the leader of a New York City-based public relations agency, I also have my own unique experience breaking out as a young founder. I often navigated client meetings, partner negotiations, and overall business operations. I had to be the most strategically minded person in the room while simultaneously being the youngest person there.Collectively, these experiences prompted me to cultivate a different culture for the next generation. They shaped my approach to leadership and mentorship.More Than a Stereotype As a leader always looking for new PR talent, I often received comments about how mature and advanced my leadership abilities were for someone my age, especially as a young senior leader.People were surprised that someone from my generation could be at the advanced stage at which I found myself in my career. I have since taken that learning and applied it to the young professionals who I manage today.In other words, I infuse in them the expectation—versus the surprise or doubt—that they can advance as quickly as they can put their mind in action to do so.No assumptionsAs Gen Z navigates the complicated professional world following the 2020 pandemic disruption to their educational and personal lives that no other generation since the early 1900s flu epidemic had to navigate, I take any and all assumptions about this generation with a grain of salt. I’m placing a deep investment in helping them realize their dreams.I’m not surprised that leaders in today’s business world, almost like incumbents, are raising red flags about the new arrivals, mistaking differences for deterrents. That’s been true of every new generation to enter the workforce.These leaders undermine not only their industries but also the broader business landscape and, ultimately, the very companies they claim to serve, forgetting that today’s entry-level employees are tomorrow’s breakthrough innovators, mid- or senior-level managers, and changemakers.An opportunity and obligationAmid all the negative buzz on the state of Gen Z workers, so many overlook that Gen Z brings real value to the table right now.As leaders, we have the opportunity and the obligation to seek out aspirational talent, treat them like who they could become, and meet them where they are as the ultimate support approach to help them get to where they ultimately could be.If leaders aren’t flexible enough to connect with and bridge differences in the workplace, collaborate more effectively, and help raise the next generation of talent to the highest level, they have lost the most important aspect of cutting-edge leadership: the ability to adapt to a continuously changing environment while continuing to lead effectively.That means inducting the next generation into America’s workforce with open arms, open hearts, and a teachable mindset.But How?Today’s leaders must stop focusing on Gen Z’s divisive stereotypes. They need to start focusing on the individuals they meet—who may be from any generation, but especially this generation—to unlock their unmistakable talent and innovative potential.Here’s how.1. Start EarlyFocus on cultivating talent at the internship level.For burgeoning professionals, the word is out: Internships matter, and they are clamoring for hands-on learning opportunities.At my agency, we receive a deluge of applications every season, selecting just a handful for an interview. Only a few will receive an internship offer.This selectivity allows us to best invest our time and attention in every intern. We spend a lot of time ensuring each intern fully understands the task at hand, so they can work for us and with us, not just complete low-level tasks without guidance or growth-minded intention.We value our interns in the same way we value all our team members.While some will find that PR isn’t their thing (and you will find that some of your interns are not the right fit for your company or industry), others will become rock stars who we want to cultivate into full-time team members.Ultimately, we want our interns to know exactly what it’s like to work at a PR agency so that whether we hire them or they move on to the next opportunity, they are in a position to succeed.Everyone benefits when we take this approach.2. Mentor at Each PhaseMentorship is for everyone. Whether seasoned executives or fresh faces out of college, we all have room to grow.Even as the owner of the company, there’s still work to do.This isn’t diminutive. It’s empowering.Mentoring gives the right guidance to the right people at the right time so they feel successful at work, value their position, and want to stay longer. It’s a win-win-win.Practically, effective mentoring empowers executive decision-making by stepping back and being available but at the same time making Gen Z-age professionals accountable for making decisions.3. Invest in ConnectionAs a busy leader, connecting with people often feels like the last thing I can smash into my schedule. It’s also the most important.With my team, daily personal engagement consists of team touch bases at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time (10:30 a.m. on Fridays) and 4 p.m. Eastern time Monday through Thursday, with an additional casual 12:15 p.m. meeting for water cooler discussions.The team operates virtually with set hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Eastern time, balancing structured connection points that typically last 20 to 30 minutes, with flexibility for personal appointments and family needs. 4. Prioritize Recreation and CelebrationRegardless of generation, people want to be seen. That’s why we prioritize recreation and celebration.Notably, for every birthday and work anniversary, we send flowers to employees and make birthdays special with social media shout-outs and advance planning to ensure proper recognition.Our team also holds two major annual celebrations—a summer retreat and family party—and we invest our time and money to give employees time away from work to feel celebrated and acknowledged for their hard work throughout the year.All these celebrations are deliberately planned to make employees feel special and valued, with an emphasis on ensuring these are genuine breaks from work responsibilities.5. Live by ExampleAt the end of the day, teaching is only as effective as your practice. Even as Gen Zers develop their own opinions, perspectives, and preferences, they are looking at leaders and taking notes.For my staff, this means that on vacation time, we prioritize true disconnection, requiring employees to set up out-of-office documents and making it a team effort to avoid contacting vacationing colleagues unless the situation is urgent, which I demonstrate by being unavailable during my own vacations.Outside of business hours, I don’t contact employees unless it’s urgent, believing people need downtime to feel fresh for the next day, and we actively avoid blurring lines between personal and work life to prevent frustration.What we do is more valuable than what we say, so we should take care to practice what we preach.Ready or NotGen Z workers aren’t on their way. They are here. Now.We can continue to accentuate their most sensational characteristics, or we can get to work, recognizing that every new generation brings unique values, perspectives, and competencies to the workforce.We can cultivate these through intentional mentorship, structured support, and genuine investment in their growth. As a business leader, I’ve discovered that Gen Z brings fresh perspectives, digital fluency, and innovative thinking to our organization.Their approach to work-life integration, commitment to purpose-driven careers, and ability to adapt to rapid change aren’t weaknesses. As the older range of the Gen Z generation approaches their mid-twenties in 2025, they need to be recognized as assets that we should all embrace and integrate now because, ready or not, Gen Z is part of today’s workforce, and only moving upward from here.",fastcompany,https://www.fastcompany.com/91349098/gen-z-is-the-worst-at-work-right-wrong-genz-work?partner=rss,politics,

2025-07-02 10:20:17,Notorious husband and wife ‘professional tenants' indicted on 50+ criminal charges,"The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal. However, investor optimism was limited due to a new report showing private payrolls surprisingly decreased in June, raising concern over the state of the U.S. economy.The broad market index gained 0.47% and had scored a fresh all-time intraday high during the session. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.94%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded just below the flatline.The S&P 500 saw a boost after Trump posted on Truth Social about the deal between the U.S. and Vietnam. The deal includes a 20% tariff on imports from Vietnam. Shares of Nike, which manufactures approximately half of its footwear in Vietnam as well as China, were also 4% higher after the announcement.Earlier Wednesday, stocks came under some pressure after the latest report by ADP showed that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs last month. That marks the first monthly decline in ADP’s payrolls report since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected payrolls to grow by 100,000.“We, frankly, have been seeing a weakening of the labor market for months and months now, and I always wondered if it would take a negative payrolls print to get the [Federal Reserve] to pay a little bit more attention to the labor market as opposed to the inflation picture,” Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, told CNBC. “This is, on that front, what will hopefully catch some attention.”To be sure, the ADP report has a lackluster record predicting the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is due out Thursday. Economists expect growth of 110,000 jobs for June.However, if the upcoming jobs data follows the ADP report in missing expectations, a Fed interest rate cut may be on the table when policymakers meet later this month, according to CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall. There’s already been growing expectations for the Fed lowering rates at its July meeting, as the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows a roughly 23% chance of a cut, up from almost 21% a day before.“If we end up having a fairly weak employment report, then that could allow the Fed to be cutting rates,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. He also pointed out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently confirmed that the central bank would have cut rates by now if it weren’t for Trump’s tariff plans announced earlier this year.“If that were the case then, it could be the case now, especially if we have weaker-than-expected employment data,” Stovall added.Traders were also keeping an eye on Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. The measure returns to the House, where there are still hold-outs among GOP lawmakers.There’s ‘some kind of reckoning to come’ for the market, portfolio manager says Markets have largely ignored some signs that the U.S. economy could cracking over more front-and-center concerns tied to tariffs, according to Rational Dynamic Brands Fund portfolio manager Eric Clark. Once clarity on tariffs comes, he said, markets could then turn to the uncomfortable data and a potentially slowing job market.“Through the trees it’s clear that lower growth because of higher U.S. debt and demographics and higher inflation is going to be the outcome,” Clark told CNBC. “So the market will start looking at that and more closely scrutinizing multiples...there’s definitely some kind of reckoning to come”— Brian EvansEuropean equities are poised for a breakout to new highsThe setup for European equities looks attractive now that the S&P 500 has once again returned to all-time highs, according to Barclays.Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, said the STOXX Europe 600 could soon break out to new highs. He thinks the index could end the year at 570, implying more than 5% upside for the index. The index is up 6.7% year to date.“We think equities will most likely continue to climb the wall of worry in H2,” Cau wrote Wednesday in a note with the title, “Breakout in the waiting.” “Overall, no plain sailing but we think this should help Stoxx 600 break out to new highs and reach 570 by year-end, led by rotation into ytd laggards/tariff losers/exporters as Momentum looks stretched.”Of course, the index, which has been rangebound since February, has a number of challenges ahead of it, including ongoing tariff uncertainty and any fallout from the massive U.S. federal spending bill. But Cau said the risk/return profile is more attractive, now that uncertainty has likely peaked. A lower bar to clear for earnings and an accommodative central bank should also help European stocks. — Sarah MinADP report showed ‘meaningful’ job losses in small businesses, Baird’s Ross Mayfield saysBrandon Bell | Getty ImagesA hiring sign is displayed in an Auto Zone store window on June 25, 2025 in Austin, Texas. The latest ADP payrolls report was bad news for small businesses, according to Ross Mayfield of Baird.The report, which showed a loss of 33,000 jobs in June, revealed that businesses with less than 20 employees saw a net loss of 29,000 jobs. Businesses with more than 500 employees tallied a 30,000 increase in payrolls, however.“A lot of the job loss was concentrated in small business, which is maybe not surprising given the given the economic backdrop, but I think it’s meaningful given just how many people are employed by small and private businesses,” the investment strategist said. “We focus so much on the stock market, but that’s the primary driver of employment in this country, so not ideal to see small businesses shutting jobs like that.”— Sean ConlonCentene tracks for worst day in its history after pulling guidanceCentene shares headed for their worst day on record after the health care company pulled its full-year guidance.The company announced Tuesday afternoon that it was withdrawing its previously announced outlook for GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2025.

Bit Digital, which last week exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans, jumped 6%.On Tuesday, as bitcoin ETFs snapped a 15-day streak of inflows, ether ETFs saw $40 million in inflows led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. ETH ETFs came back to life in June after much concern they were becoming zombie funds.The price of the coin itself was last higher by 6%.

The broad market index has been on a big run – and additional gains may be ahead, according to a key technical pattern.The S&P 500 formed a “golden cross” on Tuesday, which is when its 50-day moving average crosses above a rising 200-day moving average. Traders view this as a bullish signal for momentum. The last time the broad market index formed a golden cross was in July 2020 as stocks were recovering from the pandemic-induced sell-off.History suggests that further gains could be around the corner: The S&P 500 has risen on a six-month basis following the past 11 golden crosses. The index has also advanced on a three-month basis after the past nine golden crosses.However, there are exceptions: After the S&P 500 formed a golden cross in May 1990, it dropped 12% over the next 12 months.

2025-07-02 10:18:50,"‘We will not let hate win,' Provincetown town manager says following second incident","The S&P 500 rose on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a U.S.-Vietnam trade deal. However, investor optimism was limited due to a new report showing private payrolls surprisingly decreased in June, raising concern over the state of the U.S. economy.The broad market index gained 0.47% and had scored a fresh all-time intraday high during the session. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.94%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded just below the flatline.The S&P 500 saw a boost after Trump posted on Truth Social about the deal between the U.S. and Vietnam. The deal includes a 20% tariff on imports from Vietnam. Shares of Nike, which manufactures approximately half of its footwear in Vietnam as well as China, were also 4% higher after the announcement.Earlier Wednesday, stocks came under some pressure after the latest report by ADP showed that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs last month. That marks the first monthly decline in ADP’s payrolls report since March 2023. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected payrolls to grow by 100,000.“We, frankly, have been seeing a weakening of the labor market for months and months now, and I always wondered if it would take a negative payrolls print to get the [Federal Reserve] to pay a little bit more attention to the labor market as opposed to the inflation picture,” Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, told CNBC. “This is, on that front, what will hopefully catch some attention.”To be sure, the ADP report has a lackluster record predicting the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is due out Thursday. Economists expect growth of 110,000 jobs for June.However, if the upcoming jobs data follows the ADP report in missing expectations, a Fed interest rate cut may be on the table when policymakers meet later this month, according to CFRA Research’s Sam Stovall. There’s already been growing expectations for the Fed lowering rates at its July meeting, as the CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows a roughly 23% chance of a cut, up from almost 21% a day before.“If we end up having a fairly weak employment report, then that could allow the Fed to be cutting rates,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. He also pointed out that Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently confirmed that the central bank would have cut rates by now if it weren’t for Trump’s tariff plans announced earlier this year.“If that were the case then, it could be the case now, especially if we have weaker-than-expected employment data,” Stovall added.Traders were also keeping an eye on Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, which narrowly passed the Senate on Tuesday. The measure returns to the House, where there are still hold-outs among GOP lawmakers.There’s ‘some kind of reckoning to come’ for the market, portfolio manager says Markets have largely ignored some signs that the U.S. economy could cracking over more front-and-center concerns tied to tariffs, according to Rational Dynamic Brands Fund portfolio manager Eric Clark. Once clarity on tariffs comes, he said, markets could then turn to the uncomfortable data and a potentially slowing job market.“Through the trees it’s clear that lower growth because of higher U.S. debt and demographics and higher inflation is going to be the outcome,” Clark told CNBC. “So the market will start looking at that and more closely scrutinizing multiples...there’s definitely some kind of reckoning to come”— Brian EvansEuropean equities are poised for a breakout to new highsThe setup for European equities looks attractive now that the S&P 500 has once again returned to all-time highs, according to Barclays.Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays, said the STOXX Europe 600 could soon break out to new highs. He thinks the index could end the year at 570, implying more than 5% upside for the index. The index is up 6.7% year to date.“We think equities will most likely continue to climb the wall of worry in H2,” Cau wrote Wednesday in a note with the title, “Breakout in the waiting.” “Overall, no plain sailing but we think this should help Stoxx 600 break out to new highs and reach 570 by year-end, led by rotation into ytd laggards/tariff losers/exporters as Momentum looks stretched.”Of course, the index, which has been rangebound since February, has a number of challenges ahead of it, including ongoing tariff uncertainty and any fallout from the massive U.S. federal spending bill. But Cau said the risk/return profile is more attractive, now that uncertainty has likely peaked. A lower bar to clear for earnings and an accommodative central bank should also help European stocks. — Sarah MinADP report showed ‘meaningful’ job losses in small businesses, Baird’s Ross Mayfield saysBrandon Bell | Getty ImagesA hiring sign is displayed in an Auto Zone store window on June 25, 2025 in Austin, Texas. The latest ADP payrolls report was bad news for small businesses, according to Ross Mayfield of Baird.The report, which showed a loss of 33,000 jobs in June, revealed that businesses with less than 20 employees saw a net loss of 29,000 jobs. Businesses with more than 500 employees tallied a 30,000 increase in payrolls, however.“A lot of the job loss was concentrated in small business, which is maybe not surprising given the given the economic backdrop, but I think it’s meaningful given just how many people are employed by small and private businesses,” the investment strategist said. “We focus so much on the stock market, but that’s the primary driver of employment in this country, so not ideal to see small businesses shutting jobs like that.”— Sean ConlonCentene tracks for worst day in its history after pulling guidanceCentene shares headed for their worst day on record after the health care company pulled its full-year guidance.The company announced Tuesday afternoon that it was withdrawing its previously announced outlook for GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2025.

It’s gained more than 1,000% since the announcement. Betting platform SharpLink Gaming, which has also initiated an ETH treasury strategy, added more than 16%. Bit Digital, which last week exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans, jumped 6%.On Tuesday, as bitcoin ETFs snapped a 15-day streak of inflows, ether ETFs saw $40 million in inflows led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. ETH ETFs came back to life in June after much concern they were becoming zombie funds.The price of the coin itself was last higher by 6%. It’s been struggling with an identity crisis fueled by uncertainty about Ethereum’s value proposition and weaker revenue since its last big technical upgrade and increasing competition from Solana.

2025-07-02 10:15:00,The U.S. military can't quit the Middle East,"If you're in the defense business, you've seen this meme in one form or another.""Born too late to deploy to the Middle East,"" it reads.""Born too early to deploy to the Middle East,"" it continues.""Born just in time to deploy to the Middle East,"" it concludes.Why it matters: Flippant? Yes. Compelling? Also yes, as the image's virality today reflects just how entangled the U.S. is in the troubled region, even as it promises to pivot more fully to the Chinese and Russian threat.This is geopolitical tug of war, spiked with public cynicism.Driving the news: Surprise strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities using B-2 Spirit bombers and 100-plus other aircraft marked Washington's latest foray into the Middle East, where for decades it's expended taxpayer dollars and lives. (Think Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.)Meanwhile, the Pentagon frets over Beijing and Moscow and their global ambitions. But the resources needed for that competition — including heavy-duty, traditional military hardware like aircraft carriers — are in high demand elsewhere.Friction point: ""There is a disconnect between what we, the United States, say in our national defense strategies and those sorts of products and what actually happens on the ground,"" Brian Carter, a Middle East expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told Axios.""The problem is: We episodically prioritize the Middle East over China,"" he said. ""We haven't been good about ensuring that we put enough effort into the Middle East to make sure that things don't spiral out of control.""""When we have to surge all this stuff in, we're always reactive.""Between the lines: Pentagon officials and military leaders have been hinting at this dynamic.Elbridge Colby, the undersecretary of defense for policy, has long lobbied for prioritizing China over Europe and the Middle East. During his March confirmation hearing, Colby told senators the U.S. lacks ""a multi-war military.""Indo-Pacific Command boss Adm. Samuel Paparo in November said support provided to Israel and Ukraine was ""eating into"" some of the most precious U.S. weapons stockpiles. In April, he revealed it took at least 73 flights to move a Patriot air-defense battalion out of China's backyard and into Central Command.And most recently — just days ago — Acting Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby told lawmakers the Navy is chewing through Standard Missile-3s at ""an alarming rate."" The service has used more than $1 billion in munitions fighting Houthi rebels near the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and the USS Harry S. Truman has lost three Super Hornet aircraft, including one to friendly fire.Zoom out: ""The Middle East is the space where four things come together,"" Daryl Press, the faculty director at the Davidson Institute for Global Security, said in an interview.""It's terrorism and terrorist groups.""""It's nuclear weapons and potential for proliferation.""""It's the world's most important exportable energy supplies.""""And then it's a bunch of countries which have, I would say, somewhat weak control over their borders and airspace.""The bottom line: ""This is the part of the world that continually draws the United States into conflict,"" Press said.

In the end, it turned out to be just another headfake by ADP which now has the same credibility as UMich, because moments ago the BLS published a blowout job report: in June, the US added 147K payrolls, blowing away the median estimate of 106K, and higher than the upward revised May print of 144K.Remarkable, and in a dramatic change from the Biden tradition, previous months were revised higher: April was revised up by 11,000, from +147,000 to +158,000, and the change for May was revised up by 5,000, from +139,000 to +144,000.It wasn't just the headline print that surprised to the upside: perhaps an even bigger surprise was the unemployment rate which dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%, denying expectations of an increase to 4.3%, and far below the Fed's recently upward revised estimate of a 4.5%.The drop in the unemp rate was the result of a 93K increase in employed workers, offset by a decline in the civilian labor force to 173,380K from 170,510K and a drop in the number of unemployed workers from 7,237K to 7,1025K.Developing Tyler DurdenThu, 07/03/2025 - 08:48",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/blowout-june-payrolls-147k-jobs-added-smashing-expectations-unemployment-rate-drops-41,business,

Nevertheless, this shift toward electrification in the automotive industry is inevitable. With respect to EV manufacturing, companies such as China's BYD and the USA-based Tesla are recognized as global leaders in the field.However, a Japanese researcher had already developed an supercar EV over 20 years ago, before Mr. Elon Musk's contributions at Tesla. His name is Dr. Hiroshi Shimizu, who is currently a Professor Emeritus at Keio University, Japan. In 2004, he developed an EV called ""Eliica"" that featured a cutting-edge in-wheel-motor system, in which each motor is integrated directly into the wheels. Former Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Junichiro Koizumi described Eliica as a revolutionary breakthrough in energy and industrial technology. The vehicle's acceleration—from 0 to 160 km/h—surpassed that of the Porsche 911 and achieved a top speed of 370 km/h. Dr. Shimizu's work demonstrated as early as 2004 that EVs could match or exceed the performance of high-end sports cars.Subsequently, Dr. Shimizu established a startup company named ""SIM Drive ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",benzinga,https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/07/n46243369/green-science-alliance-established-an-electric-vehicle-ev-company-utilizing-next-generation-in-whe,business,

2025-07-03 12:30:06,CoreWeave is the first cloud provider to deploy Nvidia's latest AI chips,"U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting fresh record highs, after a better-than-expected jobs report fueled optimism the U.S. economy was hanging tough despite fast-changing trade policy and geopolitics.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 357 points, or 0.8%. The S&P 500 traded 0.8% higher, while the Nasdaq gained 1%.Nonfarm payrolls rose by 147,000 in June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. That’s above the Dow Jones forecast from economists for 110,000 and the upwardly revised 144,000 in May. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, while economists had projected an increase to 4.3%.The strong jobs report also spurred a spike in Treasury yields and reduced expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon. Fed funds futures traders are currently pricing in a roughly 95% chance that the central bank will hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, per CME Group’s FedWatch tool.“The biggest implication from the employment report would seem to be there’s no way the Fed’s cutting rates in July, and it’s a question mark as to whether rates are cut at all this year,” Jed Ellerbroek, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management, said in an interview with CNBC.Thursday’s report comes a day after ADP released data showing that private payrolls decreased by 33,000 last month, raising fears that perhaps the economy was starting to stumble under the weight of rapid policy changes out of Washington. Thursday’s official government data knocked down that notion.Meanwhile, after President Donald Trump announced the U.S.-Vietnam trade agreement Wednesday, investors are eagerly awaiting any potential future deal announcements as the president’s early July deadline on his 90-day tariff pause approaches next week. While the market trading at all-time high levels leaves it open to downside, especially if Trump chooses to be “really tough” in negotiations, Ellerbroek believes the market is ultimately taking a more optimistic view. “We will see a real tariff impact for a lot of businesses, but the market is going to digest that without too much trouble,” he also said.Investors are also following along the progress on Trump’s tax megabill, which finally passed the Senate Tuesday and has since returned to the House. The bill is now headed for a final vote after the Republican-controlled House advanced the legislation Thursday.Thursday will be a shortened trading session, with the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq closing at 1 p.m. ET. U.S. markets are closed on Friday for Independence Day.All three major U.S. averages are on pace to close out the week in positive territory. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are 1.7% and 1.6% higher week to date, respectively, while the Dow is at a 2.3% gain for the period.Bessent says potential extension of tariff pauses are up to TrumpTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that, if trade deals are not reached by the time tariff pauses are set to expire next week, it is up to President Donald Trump whether the pauses or extended or if the import tax rates revert back to higher levels.“We’re going to do what the president wants, and he’ll be the one to determine their negotiating in good faith. So, I’m not going to give people a 10% extension on national TV when they should try to get it across the finish line,” Bessent said.The Treasury Secretary also downplayed the idea that the tariffs are hurting the U.S. economy.“What we’ve seen so far is that tariffs haven’t hurt. The dog that didn’t bark is that tariffs were going to hurt the economy, were going to hurt the market,” Bessent said, noting that U.S. stocks are at record highs.“I’ve made my career on listening to the market, not Wall Street economists, so I’m going to stick with what the market’s telling me,” he added.— Jesse PoundFirst Solar, CrowdStrike, Synopsys among the stocks making midday movesCheck out the stocks making moves midday on Thursday:Solar stocks — Companies tied to renewable energy rose in midmorning trading as President Donald Trump’s megabill crept closer to passage before a White House July 4 deadline. While the measure has no new carveouts for clean energy, earlier this week the Senate version of the bill dropped a tax on solar and wind projects. Panel manufacturer First Solar jumped 8%, and manufacturer of solar microinverters Enphase Energy added 5%. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) advanced more than 3%.CrowdStrike — The cybersecurity company saw shares surge roughly 4%. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives lifted his price target on the stock to $575 from $525, citing “increased momentum in the field around its cyber platform approach. ... CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names and we are seeing deal momentum spread with AI also a clear tailwind for this well positioned tech leader,” he wrote Thursday.Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems — Shares of the Silicon Valley-based chip designers rallied more than 4% each.

For example, META reported the highest [free cash flow per full time employee] for FY24 and the 3rd highest Rev/FTE for FY24,” the note said. However, Martin stayed at just a hold rating because labor productivity appears to be slowing at the same other spending, like capital expenditures and the investments in Scale AI, are growing.“Why buy META now, when META admits they are in front of a 2-3 year investment cycle with unknowable [returns on invested capital],” the note said.— Jesse PoundU.S. economy adds 147,000 in JuneJeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesWest Palm Beach, Florida, McDonald’s, fast food, exterior seating area, Now hiring sign up to $14.50, QR code to apply, teenage.

2025-07-04 11:20:00,Lots Of Speculation Is Swirling Around The Sumy Front,"Lots Of Speculation Is Swirling Around The Sumy Front Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,Ukraine claims that Russia is gearing up for a large-scale offensive there, a Russian security source denied any such plans, while the US is closely monitoring the situation...Trump told the media earlier in the week that “We'll see what happens. I'm watching it very closely” when asked about reports that Russia is gearing up for a large-scale offensive in Ukraine’s Sumy Region. This follows the Wall Street Journal’s (WSJ) report alleging that Russia has assembled 50,000 troops in preparation for that. A Russian security source denied such plans in comments to TASS, however, and instead described the aforesaid claims as part of a GUR disinfo campaign to fearmonger about Russia.They also put forth the hypothesis that GUR wants to discredit the Defense Ministry in general and Commander-in-Chief Alexander Syrsky in particular while also claiming that Ukraine also does indeed have quite a few border fortifications there unlike what the WSJ wrote. Whatever the truth may be, what’s known for sure is that Sumy Region falls within the “buffer zone” that Putin spoke about carving out in late May, the strategy of which was analyzed here at the time.The larger context concerns the realization that “The Russian-Ukrainian Talks Are At An Impasse That Only The US Or Brute Force Can Break”. Absent any serious efforts by Trump to coerce Zelensky into the concessions that Putin demands for peace, Russia might thus continue resorting to brute force to ensure its security interests, especially given the window of opportunity that reportedly just opened up. This is connected to Politico’s recent report about the Pentagon halting some promised munitions to Ukraine.According to their sources, this includes “missiles for Patriot air defense systems, precision artillery rounds, Hellfire and other missiles that Ukraine launches from its F-16 fighters and drones.” The decision was reportedly made in early June, so shortly before Israel launched its sneak attack against Iran on day 61 of Trump’s 60-day deadline for agreeing to a new nuclear deal. The timing consequently suggests that this aid that was promised to Ukraine during the Biden era might have instead been redirected to Israel.This makes sense seeing as how Trump knew about Bibi’s plans ahead of time and would have likely ordered the Pentagon to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale conflict erupting in the aftermath. The US’ stockpiles were already running low even before the 12-day war that followed, in which the US directly participated by bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities, so it was inevitable in hindsight that the US’ prioritization of Israel’s security needs would come at Ukraine’s expense.All of this sets the stage for the large-scale offensive that Ukraine claims that Russia is gearing up for, Russia denies, and the US is closely monitoring just in case. On the one hand, Russia could try to take advantage of the reduction in US military aid to Ukraine to push its buffer zone deeper into Sumy Region.On the other hand, it might not be the walk in the park that the WSJ claimed, and Trump could overreact to any major Russian gains by “escalating to de-escalate” at the risk of ruining the fragile peace process.From his view, the optics of Russia gaining lots of ground right at the moment when the US curtailed crucial military aid to Ukraine could lend false credence to conspiracy theories about collusion between him and Putin, while his legacy would be tarnished if the US then “loses Ukraine” as a result. These perceptions raise the chance that he’d overreact to that scenario. Therefore, Putin might not approve of such military plans to avoid jeopardizing talks with Trump, if he even had those plans to begin with.

2025-07-04 11:00:01,"I visited Universal Studios and people were on their phones everywhere—even rollercoasters: That habit is ‘really hard to break,' expert says","Analysts say the fears of regulatory headwinds are overblown as Gen Zers and millennials, rather than young children, are Pop Mart’s main consumer demographic. Local peers that focus on minors, on the other hand, will likely be “heavily impacted,” one analyst said. But although the Labubu frenzy shows no sign of slowing, Pop Mart faces other challenges.Beijing may have warned against “blind box” toys, but analysts are betting that Pop Mart International — the company behind Labubu dolls — will remain one of China’s hottest consumer brands this year.In an editorial on June 20, China’s state media People’s Daily called for tighter regulations around selling blind-boxed toys and trading cards to children under the age of eight, such as verifying buyers’ age upon payment and requiring parental approval in online transactions.Without naming Beijing-headquartered Pop Mart, the paper slammed businesses for enticing young children to spend heavily on “blind cards” and “mystery boxes” — a model central to Pop Mart’s appeal. The company often sells its dolls in a blind box to buyers who don’t know what character is inside until they open it.Sequentially, Pop Mart’s share price plunged 12.1% for the week ending June 20, marking its steepest fall since late 2023, denting a massive rally that sent its shares over 600% higher over the last 12 months.Its stock has regained some ground since then, hovering near the all-time high levels hit in mid-June.The state media commentary on blind-box toys is reminiscent of Beijing’s regulations on video games in recent years, which were aimed at curbing gaming addiction and unsupervised in-game purchases by minors.That led to restrictions on how long minors can play video games, as part of a sector-wide crackdown that wiped out billions of dollars in value from China’s gaming giants.Visual China Group | Getty ImagesA boy playing a video game with a headset during the 2019 NetEase Future Conference at Hangzhou International Expo Center on Nov. 23, 2019, in Hangzhou, China.“The magnitude of Chinese policymakers’ impact [on businesses] is way higher than that in other countries,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, senior advisor for the China Center at The Conference Board, a think tank.That said, analysts view the fears of regulatory headwinds as overblown as Gen Zers and millennials, rather than young children, are Pop Mart’s main consumer demographic.Pop Mart will largely be insulated from intensifying regulatory scrutiny as it targets younger adults with adequate purchasing power, Montufar-Helu said.Local peers that focus on minors, however, will likely be “heavily impacted,” said Jeff Zhang, equity analyst at Morningstar.There’s another factor that could cushion the regulatory impact on Pop Mart. It’s increasingly driven by overseas sales, especially in Southeast Asia, Zhang said. And the share of its China revenue will fall to about 30% in the next 10 years, he projected. Pop Mart’s overseas sales in 2024 have already surpassed the company’s overall sales in 2021.Pop Mart derived about 61% of its revenue from mainland China in 2024, according to its annual report, drawing the rest mainly from Southeast Asia and East Asia, as well as Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.Its sales in North America grew more than 550% last year from a year earlier, and the company has 90 physical stores and vending machine spots across the United States.HSBC Bank expects Pop Mart’s overseas revenue in 2025 to more than double to 14 billion yuan ($1.95 billion) from 2024 on strong sales momentum from “Labubu 3.0,” released in April. This figure would account for more than half of its entire projected revenue this year, up from 39% in 2024. That just builds on the meteoric growth that the company enjoyed last year, when revenue more than doubled to 13.04 billion yuan, while profits nearly tripled.Dopamine economyThe rapidly growing popularity of the ugly-cute toys contrasts with otherwise sluggish consumption in the country, as many become increasingly frugal in the face of an economic slowdown.Younger Chinese consumers want to build toy collections for the sense of “affordable exclusivity” it gives them, said Montufar-Helu, as it can be satisfying to be “one of the lucky ones to get the special edition” at a reasonable price.Pop Mart sells blind-boxed toys with prices ranging from about 59 yuan to 5,999 yuan. Collectors often spend hundreds or thousands of yuan, and rare models can fetch six-figure sums at second hand auctions.Medianews Group | Getty ImagesDiana Lagaret (left) and Sahar Kutlu show off some of the Labubu items for sale at The Labu’Tique Shop in Anaheim on June 25, 2025.“The very point about blind boxes is the unknown, the uncertainty. There is some inherent curiosity about what someone’s gonna get. That brings about a certain degree of excitement when people are buying blind boxes,” said Chris Wong, senior clinical psychologist at Singapore-based Resilienz Clinic. “When that uncertainty is resolved,” he said, referring to when the blind box is opened, “[that] usually comes with certain pleasant emotions, like fun, surprise and delight. That also plays a part in why people just keep on doing that.”Seeing others share their own experiences of blind boxes on social media also amplifies such a response from the brain, as it fulfils the human need for social connection, the psychologist said.Scalpers, counterfeits, production delaysBut although the Labubu frenzy shows no sign of slowing, Pop Mart still faces other challenges that may dent its momentum, analysts said.“While Pop Mart’s major IPs, such as Labubu have received some global popularity over the past two years ... there is no guarantee that what is popular now will stay relevant over the next five to ten years,” Zhang said.Other risks include uncertainty around the company’s ability to meet shifting demand and scalping, which could drive genuine consumers out of the market, HSBC analysts said.Pop Mart issued a rare apology last month after a surge in orders caused delivery delays, with consumers complaining online about not having receiving orders weeks after placing them.Counterfeit toys may also dampen Pop Mart’s reputation at home and abroad, analysts said, despite the government’s efforts in stepping up scrutiny at export checkpoints.Customs at the Ningbo port, one of the country’s busiest ports, seized over a million counterfeit Labubu dolls in the first six months of this year, over intellectual property violations and smuggling concerns.Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesThis picture taken on June 18, 2025 shows the character Labubu taking part in a performance at the Pop Mart’s theme park Pop Land in Beijing. To keep its brand fresh, Pop Mart has taken a page from Disney’s playbook, doubling down on expanding its IP portfolio, launching pop-up stores, a film studio and a theme park.Pop Mart’s founder Wang Ning once hinted at his aspiration to turn the company into “China’s Disney.”But those initiatives don’t come cheap.“Animation production requires a strong storytelling team that can consistently deliver compelling narratives,” said Echo Gong, an independent Shanghai-based retail consumption consultant. She added that managing a theme park also demands an entirely different skillset and far greater investment than simply selling toys.— CNBC’s Evelyn Cheng contributed to this story.",nbcphiladelphia,https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/i-visited-universal-studios-and-people-were-on-their-phones-everywhere-even-rollercoasters-that-habit-is-really-hard-to-break-expert-says/4226460/,business,

Rand Paul, R-Ky., who said the bill’s budget “explodes the deficit” and continues a pattern of “short-term politicking over long-term sustainability.” The House of Representatives narrowly passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on Thursday, sending it to Trump to sign into law.Paul and Musk have been vocal opponents of Trump’s tax and spending bill, and repeatedly called out the potential for the spending package to increase the national debt.On Monday, Musk called it the “DEBT SLAVERY bill.” The independent Congressional Budget Office has said the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion of U.S. debt over the next decade.

2025-07-04 10:46:38,Ethereum is powering Wall Street's future. The crypto scene at Cannes shows how far it's come,"Crypto founders, developers, and some of the institutional giants gathered at the Ethereum Community Conference, or EthCC, in Cannes, France. Ethereum’s institutional adoption is accelerating, with BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Coinbase, and Kraken all building directly on its rails. Robinhood became the first public U.S. company to launch tokenized stocks on-chain, using Ethereum’s Arbitrum network.CANNES — Wall Street’s new plumbing is being built on Ethereum and this week its architects took over the same French Riviera villas and red carpet venues that host the Cannes Film Festival in May.The Ethereum Community Conference, or EthCC, took over the beachside town that was swarming with crypto founders, developers, and some of the institutional giants now building atop the infrastructure.The crypto elite climbed the iconic red-carpeted steps of the Palais des Festivals — a cinematic landmark now repurposed as the stage for Ethereum’s flagship European event.“The atmosphere this year was palpable in Cannes,” said Bettina Boon Falleur, the powerhouse behind EthCC for the past seven years. “The prestige of the location, combined with the quality of talks, has reinforced Ethereum’s stature and purpose in the wider ecosystem.”Private parties sprawled across cliffside estates and exclusive resorts, but the conversations were less about price action and more about the blockchain’s evolving role as the back-end of global finance.EthCC, now in its eighth year, has tracked Ethereum’s trajectory from scrappy experiment to institutional backbone.“That impact was unmistakable this year,” Falleur said. “From Robinhood embracing decentralized finance infrastructure via Arbitrum to local governments like the City of Cannes exploring deeper integration with the crypto economy.”Indeed, one of the boldest moves came this week from Robinhood, which became the first publicly traded U.S. company to launch tokenized stocks on-chain.At a product showcase held inside a Belle Époque mansion overlooking the sea, Robinhood unveiled a sweeping new crypto strategy — including the ability for European users to trade tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs via Arbitrum, a Layer 2 network built on Ethereum.The announcement helped push Robinhood stock past $100 for the first time, capping off a week of fresh all-time highs and a more than 30% rally since being snubbed by the S&P 500 during a recent rebalance.Ether, the token native to the Ethereum blockchain, was up nearly 6% on the week and several public equities tied to the blockchain have rallied alongside it.BitMine Immersion Technologies, a company that mines bitcoin, gained more than 1,200% since announcing it would make ether its primary treasury reserve asset. Bit Digital, which recently exited bitcoin mining to “become a pure play” ethereum staking and treasury company, gained more than 34% this week. And SharpLink Gaming, which added more than $20 million in ether to its balance sheet this week, jumped more than 28% on Thursday.Ether ETF inflows are rising again too — a sign that institutional investors are warming back up.Ether is still down more than 20% this year and lags far behind bitcoin in market cap and adoption. But funds tracking ETH have seen two straight months of mostly net inflows, according to CoinGlass data. Still, ether ETFs total just $11 billion — compared to $138 billion in bitcoin ETFs.Institutions aren’t betting on Ethereum for hype — they’re betting on infrastructure.Even as prices stall and the network faces headwinds from slower base layer revenues and faster rivals like Solana, the momentum is shifting toward utility.“Ethereum is getting plugged into these core transactional systems,” Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY, told CNBC on the sidelines of EthCC. “Investors, savers, people moving money — they are going to start shifting from some of the older mechanisms of doing this into Ethereum ecosystems that can do these transactions faster, cheaper, but also very importantly, with significant new functionality attached to it.”MacKenzie SigalosCrypto founders and developers climb the iconic red-carpeted steps of the Palais des Festivals — a familiar backdrop for the Cannes Film Festival, now repurposed for Ethereum’s flagship European event.Deutsche Bank recently announced it’s building a tokenization platform on zkSync — a faster, cheaper blockchain built on top of Ethereum — to help asset managers issue and manage tokenized funds, stablecoins, and other real-world assets while meeting regulatory and data protection requirements.Coinbase and Kraken are also racing to own the crossover between traditional stocks and crypto.Coinbase has filed with the SEC to offer trading in tokenized public equities, a move that would diversify its revenue stream and bring it into more direct competition with brokerages like Robinhood and eToro.Kraken announced plans to offer 24/7 trading of U.S. stock tokens in select overseas markets.BlackRock‘s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL — launched on Ethereum last year — offers qualified investors on-chain access to yield with redemptions settled in USDC in real time.Stablecoins, meanwhile, continue to serve as the backbone of Ethereum’s financial layer.Circle’s USDC — the second-largest stablecoin — still settles around 65% of its volume on Ethereum’s rails. According to CoinGecko’s latest “State of Stablecoins” report, Ethereum accounts for nearly 50% of stablecoin market share.“The builders and contributors at EthCC aren’t chasing the next bull run,” Falleur said, “they’re laying the groundwork to make Ethereum home for the next billion users.”Even as newer blockchains tout faster speeds and lower fees, Ethereum is proving its staying power as a trusted network.Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, told CNBC in Cannes that there is an assumption that institutions only care about scale and speed — but in practice, it’s the opposite.EthCCEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin delivers a keynote at ETHCC, laying out the network’s next steps — and its values test — as institutional adoption accelerates.“A lot of institutions basically tell us to our faces that they value Ethereum because it’s stable and dependable, because it doesn’t go down,” he said.Buterin added that firms often ask about privacy and other long-term features — the kinds of concerns that institutions, he said, “really value.”Tomasz Stańczak, the new co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, said institutions are choosing Ethereum for the same core reasons.“Ten years without stopping for a moment. Ten years of upgrades, with a huge dedication to security and censorship resistance,” he said.He added that when institutions send orders to the market, they want to be “absolutely sure that their order is treated fairly, that nobody has preference, that the transaction actually is executed at the time when it’s delivered.”Those guarantees have become increasingly valuable as stablecoins and tokenized assets move into the mainstream.The Senate’s recent passage of the GENIUS Act, along with Circle’s IPO, gave the industry a regulatory tailwind and helped reinforce Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer for tokenized finance.Ethereum’s core values — neutrality, security, and censorship resistance — are emerging as competitive advantages.The real test now is whether Ethereum can scale without losing its values.“We don’t just want to succeed,” Buterin said from the mainstage of the Palais this week. “We want to be something that is worthy of succeeding.”He said the hope is that future generations will look back and see a network that truly delivered openness, freedom, and permissionless access to the masses.MacKenzie SigalosWhite-clad guests dance poolside at the rAAVE party in Cannes.But the week didn’t end in the conference halls, it closed with tradition. On the balcony of Villa Montana, overlooking the Bay of Cannes, the rAAVE party lit up.White-clad guests sipped cocktails as the DJ spun by the pool, haze curling from smoke machines.This year, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov and DeFi icon Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave, stood atop the balcony overlooking the crowd and the light-dotted skyline of Cannes.It was a fitting snapshot of the momentum behind Ethereum’s institutional rise and symbolic of Web3’s shift from niche experiment to financial mainstay.WATCH: Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explains ‘dual purpose’ behind trading platform’s new crypto offerings",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/ethereum-is-powering-wall-streets-future-the-crypto-scene-at-cannes-shows-how-far-its-come/3862198/,business,

2025-07-04 10:45:00,US Patriotism Among Democrats Crashes As Marxist Demands Grow Louder,"US Patriotism Among Democrats Crashes As Marxist Demands Grow Louder Ahead of the Fourth of July, new polling shows a sharp decline in U.S. national pride, driven mainly by crazed Democrats, some of whom have increasingly spewed anti-American rhetoric, with talking points that sound straight from adversarial regimes like the Communist Party of China.Democrats are mostly in opposition to President Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" agenda that calls for strong borders, boosting domestic manufacturing (look at this!), reclaiming critical supply chains for technologies that will control the 2030s, stripping fraud and waste from the federal government, and resolving national security threats on the Homeland through the deportation of criminal illegal aliens.These news findings are from a June 2-19 Gallup poll that shows a record-low 58% of U.S. adults are ""Extremely/Very proud"", 41% ""Extremely proud,"" and 17% ""Very proud"" to be an American. The drop in national pride has been led mainly by Democrats, with only 36% now saying they are extremely or very proud to be American, down from 62% a year ago. Pride among independents has also fallen to a new low of 53%, a seven-point decline from last year. In contrast, Republicans' national pride has increased, with 92% expressing strong pride last month. The broader picture of the Democratic Party's mindset can be summed up by leftist political commentator Elie Mystal, who openly despises America and, earlier this week, called for the international community to sanction the country. It's worth noting that Mystal has deep connections to the Democratic Party's NGO network... go figure.Elie Mystal: ""Our country is THE bad guy on the world stage.

2025-07-04 11:00:00,Trump's crowning moment is ammo for Dems in '26,"With B-2 bombers booming above, President Trump will deliver a motherlode of campaign promises for his supporters Friday, decimate his predecessor's priorities and demonstrate his total dominance over the Republican Party.Why it matters: The MAGA mega bill is more than just an indisputable victory for the president and the party he has remade in his image.It's also a stinging defeat for Democrats — but has given them fodder for the 2026 midterms.With the stroke of his signature, Trump will undo the solar, wind and electric vehicles tax cuts that were at the core of President Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act.Trump will sign into law some long-term GOP goals, like making business tax credits permanent, changing how Congress counts tax cuts, pouring billions into border security, and slowing the growth of Medicaid and SNAP spending.The big tax cuts will apply this year. Most of the spending cuts will hit after the midterms.""It's going to make this country into a rocket ship,"" Trump said.Zoom out: The country will little note, nor long remember how Congress passed this bill: the all-nighters, the nail-biters and the GOP false fighters, who ultimately tapped out for Trump.But Democrats will make it their mission to ensure that voters don't forget what Trump and congressional Republicans did in the bill.The tax cuts, they say, will benefit the already-wealthy the most — and the Medicaid cuts that target the poor could devastate health care options for millions.Democrats will concede they lost on policy, but convinced they'll win — eventually — on the politics.For eight hours and 45 minutes Thursday, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries held up the GOP-led chamber's vote in favor of Trump's big bill, energizing his party (and his donors) by previewing attack lines certain to be distilled to 30-second TV ads for the 2026 campaign.""This is a crime scene,"" he thundered from the House floor.The intrigue: Democrats will mischievously borrow some Republican lines that were dropped along the way amid GOP anxiety over the bill's impacts.""The Medicaid stuff in here is bad,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).""Garbage,"" declared Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) earlier this week. ""It's a good bill overall,"" he said after voting for it.Expect those comments — along with Sen. Joni Ernst's ""we are all going to die"" shrug when the Iowa Republican was asked about Medicaid cuts — to be featured on local TV stations.By the numbers: In all, the tax cuts total $4.5 trillion over a decade, leading to $3.3 trillion in deficit spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Republicans will say the real winners are the 83% of households that would have been hit with a tax increase if Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had expired at the end of the year.Democrats will focus on the more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which is projected to put nearly 12 million Americans at risk of losing their health care and threaten rural hospitals across the country.Trump is giving his MAGA faithful $170 billion in border and immigration funds and $150 billion for defense spending.The oil and gas industry got many of its priorities.Also tucked into the bill: a rise in the nation's debt ceiling by $5 trillion.Then there are the Trumpian touches to the bill, such as no taxes on tips, a suggestion he got from a Las Vegas waitress.And for babies lucky enough to be born during Trump's second reign, there are $1,000 checks, to be placed in ""Trump accounts.""But Trump quietly gave up on his plans to tax carried interest as regular income, a major win for the private equity industry.The bottom line: Four score and seven days ago, the S&P 500 closed at its lowest point of Trump's presidency.Yesterday it closed at a new record high, its seventh this year.The economy — for now — appears to be shrugging off his tariffs, with the Labor Department reporting 147,000 new jobs in June, defying expectations.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/04/trump-big-beautiful-bill-democrats-2026,politics,
2025-07-04 11:00:00,America's nonstop birthday party,"Starting with America's 250th birthday celebration, President Trump is planning a years-long mega-celebration that puts him at the center of the world's biggest events.Why it matters: Trump's vision for the semiquincentennial goes beyond purely American fare to showcase the country's military, economic and cultural power on a global stage.His expansive vision for a nonstop American celebration includes the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, The Atlantic recently reported.Trump is floating additional programming like a ""Great American State Fair,"" ""Patriot Games"" and a ""Freedom Plane"" inspired by the Bicentennial-era ""Freedom Train.""In keeping with his love of spectacle, a New Year's Eve-style ball drop in Times Square has been discussed.Driving the news: Trump's speech at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Thursday night served as the formal kickoff to the celebrations and an opportunity to brag about congressional Republicans passing his ""one big, beautiful bill.""The president soft-launched 250 this year with a rare military parade to honor the Army in D.C., which coincided with nationwide ""No Kings"" and anti-ICE protests.More military branches' birthdays will be recognized this fall, with celebrations planned for the Marines and Navy.Trump said last night his 250th anniversary plans include a UFC fight on the grounds of the White House.Zoom in: Some of the planned activities for America 250 are more squarely around American pride, like a student-focused America's Field Trip.Trump wants his proposed sculpture park, dubbed the National Garden of American Heroes, to be ready by July 2026. The plans feature life-size statues of figures like Ronald Reagan, Whitney Houston and Jackie Robinson — ""all approved by Trump,"" as the Wall Street Journal reported.""We're going to have a big, big celebration, as you know — 250 years,"" Trump said at Arlington Cemetery in late May. ""In some ways, I'm glad I missed that second term because I wouldn't be your president for that. Can you imagine? I missed that four years. And now look what I have.""Reality check: The turbocharged celebrations come as Americans report record-low levels of patriotic pride.State of play: Preparations for America's 250th birthday have been underway since roughly 2016 under former President Obama, though they've taken a more MAGA bent since January.There are two main organizers at the national level: the White House's Task Force 250, which Trump chairs and established via an executive order in his first week in office, and the congressional America250 Commission, which was established in 2016, meant to be nonpartisan and is backed by a nonprofit.Ex-Fox News producer Ariel Abergel, who interned in Trump's first White House and finished college in 2021, is now America250's executive director.Other Trump allies like fundraiser Meredith O'Rourke and Trump adviser Chris LaCivita serve roles in the foundation supporting the America250 commission's work.Outside of the federal planning effort, expect state-level programming across the country.The intrigue: Donors to America250 include companies that have been seen as Trump-friendly, like Amazon, Coinbase and the Ultimate Fighting Championship.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/04/americas-250-birthday-festivities-trump,politics,

He shared that Iran had communicated their plan to “take 14 shots” at a U.S. base as a counteraction to the U.S.’s bombing of their nuclear facilities. Trump’s response was, “Go ahead, I understand.”According to a Fox News report, Trump said, ""You know, they called me to tell me they have to take a shot at us. This was Iran, very respectful.

He also accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ""mocking"" US-led peace efforts.Zelensky suggested something similar, painting a picture that Trump is still getting 'played' by the Russian leader, who has no authentic intent to end the war.""Massive Russian attack last night has caused fires and much damage, including to the Polish consulate in Kyiv,"" Sikorski wrote in the post. ""President Trump, Putin is mocking your peace efforts. Please restore supplies of anti-aircraft ammunition to Ukraine and impose tough new sanctions on the aggressor.""Sikorski, however, separately confirmed that no one was harmed in the embassy strike, also suggesting little damage.Trump has described that he was ""very disappointed"" by the Putin call, while a Friday call with Zelensky centered on the Ukrainian leader urging new, tougher sanctions on Moscow.But Trump has resisted this, also amid similar requests from European allies, given the likelihood of this ending a path toward negotiated settlement altogether.Ukraine is the first country to stop 400+ Shahed drones per night using interceptor drones, the Telegraph.The old model — shoot down $20k drones with $1M missiles — no longer works.NATO is studying Ukraine’s model, but has no working equivalent yet. 1/ pic.twitter.com/ORvT8xjDz6— Tymofiy Mylovanov (@Mylovanov) July 5, 2025Trump is also busy trying to salvage bilateral US relations with Russia as part of the process.

2025-07-05 15:40:00,One Big Beautiful Budget Deficit,"One Big Beautiful Budget Deficit By Philip Marey, Senior US strategist at RabobankSummaryOn Thursday, Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that is supposed to include all Trump’s promises on fiscal policy in his second term. The bill includes tax cuts and additional spending on Republican priorities. The bill will extend the income tax provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, which were set to expire by the end of the year and would have caused a fiscal cliff. There will be tax deductions for taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security. The bill includes additional spending on defense and immigration enforcement.To finance the tax cuts and additional spending, or at least some of it, there are tax increases for and spending cuts in Democratic priorities. The tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act will be terminated. What’s more, new taxes on wind and solar energy projects will be imposed if they use too much foreign content. Federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be reduced and the slack should be picked up by the states. There will also be cuts in spending on Medicaid, the health care program for low-income people. Finally, at the request of Trump, and much to the dismay of the fiscal hawks, the debt limit will be raised by $5 trillion.On balance, budget deficits are projected to rise by $3.4 trillion over the 2025-2034 period according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. However, the bill front-loads tax cuts and delays spending cuts, causing a fiscal cliff at the end of 2028 that will create political pressure in 2028 to extend the tax cuts and kick the spending cuts further down the road. Therefore, the upward impact on budget deficits in the next 10 years could be even larger.Despite the large rise in the budget deficit, the upward impact on the growth trajectory of the US economy is likely to be limited. A large part of what the Republicans and their proxies are trying to sell as “tax cuts” are actually extensions of the TCJA, which have been widely anticipated.Meanwhile, the increase in defense spending is relatively modest and keeps it below what other NATO members have pledged (as percentage of GDP). Despite all the talk about Trump’s “grand strategy”, this means that US foreign policy ambitions will be severely limited in the coming decade: a victory for the isolationists.The One Big Beautiful Budget Act of 2025 underlines that two traditional wings of the Republican Party, the fiscal hawks and the foreign policy hawks, have been pushed aside by the MAGA movement.Introduction The US Congress has passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that is supposed to include all Trump’s promises on fiscal policy in his second term. The self-imposed deadline was for the Senate and the House of Representatives to get a uniform bill to President Trump’s desk by July 4. On Tuesday, in the Senate, Vice President Vance had to step in as the tie breaker, because 50 senators voted in favor of the bill (50 Republicans) and 50 against (all 47 Democrats and 3 Republicans). Rand Paul voted “nay” because of the rise in the debt limit. In contrast, Susan Collins and Thom Tillis found the Medicaid cuts too deep to support the bill. Today, in the final vote of the House of Representatives, there were 218 votes in favor of the bill (218 Republicans) and 214 against (all 212 Democrats and 2 Republicans). Thomas Massie voted against the bill because he wanted more spending cuts, calling the bill a “debt bomb”, and at the other end of the Republican spectrum Brian Fitzpatrick – who supported the earlier House version of the bill – objected to the deeper cuts in Medicaid and SNAP.What’s in the bill?The One Big Beautiful Budget Act (OBBBA) of 2025 includes tax cuts and additional spending on Republican priorities. The bill will extend the income tax provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the main fiscal policy package of Trump’s first term. These tax cuts were set to expire by the end of the year and would have caused a fiscal cliff. There will be tax deductions for taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security, in line with Trump’s promises of “no taxes” on these three sources of income during his 2024 campaign. There will also be a rise in child tax credits. The deduction cap on state and local taxes (SALT) will also be raised, at the request of Republican lawmakers in high tax states.The bill includes additional spending on defense and immigration enforcement. The latter will be improved by extending the border wall, increased detention of migrants, and additional funds for ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). The largest items in defense spending are shipbuilding, the Golden Dome defense system against foreign missiles, and replenishing the stock of ammunition. However, this would still leave defense spending at about 2.7% of GDP by 2034, which is well below the target that other NATO members have pledged at the recent summit in The Hague. Of course, compared to these countries the US has spent much more in cumulative terms, but the more relevant benchmark is what is needed against enemy countries. To put this in a historical perspective: when the US tried to outrun the Soviet Union during the Reagan years the US spent more than 6% of GDP.To finance the tax cuts and additional spending, or at least some of it, there are tax increases for and spending cuts in Democratic priorities. The tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act will be terminated. This was one of Trump’s campaign pledges. What’s more, new taxes on wind and solar energy projects will be imposed if they use too much foreign content. Federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will be reduced and the slack should be picked up by the states. There will also be cuts in spending on Medicaid, the health care program for low-income people. However, they have been eased to keep the so-called “Medicaid moderates” on board. The fiscal hawks wanted more spending cuts, but the Republican leadership needed to keep the centrists on board, given the small margins in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Finally, at the request of Trump, and much to the dismay of the fiscal hawks, the debt limit will be raised.What’s not in the billTo the relief of foreign investors, and spurred on by the US business sector, the proposed introduction of Section 899 to the Internal Revenue Code has been removed from the One Big Beautiful Bill because of a forthcoming international tax agreement announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Section 899 would have introduced retaliatory taxes on foreign companies from countries that impose “unfair taxes” on US companies, such as undertaxed profits rules, digital services taxes, and diverted profits taxes. However, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith have stated that the US Congress could still adopt Section 899 if the new international tax agreement is violated. What has never been in any version of the bill is a serious attempt to rein in spending on Social Security and Medicare. Consequently, US public debt remains on a trajectory that hardly seems sustainable in the long run.The budget impact of the billOn July 1, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill as passed by the Senate would decrease budget deficits by $0.4 trillion, relative to the budget enforcement baseline for consideration in the Senate. Of course this sounds great and is what the Republicans and their proxies are trying to sell to the public. However, this baseline – imposed by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham – already assumes an extension of the TCJA income tax provisions. On its own this is a choice that could be defended, however when the CBO scored the TCJA in 2017 they assumed that these tax provisions would expire, in line with then current law and with the common practice of budget scoring by the CBO. So taken together, the budget impact of these tax extensions has been deleted. This is truly One Big Beautiful Magic Act. As Lindsay Graham put it last week: “I’m the king of the numbers, I’m Zeus, the budget king.” With a simple shift-in-accounting trick1, $3.8 trillion has disappeared into a black hole of time inconsistency. In the same letter on July 1, the nonpartisan CBO stated that compared with their January 2025 baseline budget projections, it would increase deficits over the 2025-2034 period by $3.4 trillion. So in reality, the OBBBA has a significant upward impact on the budget deficit.What’s more, the bill front-loads tax cuts in the next few years and delays spending cuts, causing a rise in the budget deficit in the short run and political pressure down the road to extend the tax cuts, further increasing annual budget deficits. Many deficit-increasing measures are scheduled to expire in 2028, while many deficit-reducing measures do not start until after 2028.This would create a large fiscal cliff in 2028 that could force another extension of tax cuts, similar to the response that we are seeing this year in anticipation of a 2025 fiscal cliff that would emerge if the OBBBA had been rejected. Keep in mind that in November 2028 elections will take place for the presidency, the House of Representatives and one third of the Senate. In addition to extending tax cuts, there may be pressure to undo much of the deficit reduction scheduled by the OBBBA to take place after 2028. This could increase the upward impact of the bill on the budget deficit in the next ten years from $3.3 trillion to $4.8 trillion according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). In other words, the OBBBA of 2025 would repeat the same trick used in the TCJA of 2017 by keeping the projected upward impact on the federal deficit limited through sunsets that are very likely to cause extensions of deficit-increasing measures when the fiscal cliffs comes in sight. These measures are only temporary in name, in reality they are permanent.The economic impact of the billDespite the large rise in the budget deficit, the upward impact on the growth trajectory of the US economy is likely to be limited. A large part of what the Republicans and their proxies are trying to sell as “tax cuts” are actually extensions of the income tax provisions in the TCJA. In fact, the One Big Beautiful Bill is removing the fiscal cliff that loomed at the end of this year. What’s more, the extension has been widely anticipated because the Republicans could not afford the fiscal cliff from an electoral perspective. So this should not change the growth projections of the US economy. The additional stimulus would come from the other tax cuts, which are considerably smaller.No serious attempt has been made to improve the US public debt trajectory. Fiscal discipline has gone out of the window on Capitol Hill and the few remaining fiscal hawks are at best slowing down the upward trajectory of the debt. This leaves the enforcement of US fiscal discipline to the bond vigilantes. However, they are faced with limited alternatives to US treasuries. Nevertheless, as far as they are able and willing to diversify away from US treasuries, they could demand higher yields. In the long run, this is increasingly likely. Either through higher interest rates or through higher tax rates if US lawmakers are going to put their fiscal house in order, this budget explosion could slow down economic growth down the road. However for now, the low tax rates of the TCJA have been extended and some new tax cuts have been added. Just stop thinking about tomorrow.The foreign policy impact of the billDespite all the talk about Trump’s “grand strategy”, defense spending in the One Big Beautiful Bill does not seem compatible with preserving US military dominance. Cutting taxes (or extending tax cuts) without touching Social Security and Medicare has left little room for increasing defense spending. This means that US foreign policy ambitions will be severely limited in the coming decade. In this sense the OBBBA is also a victory for the isolationists. While the recent US attack on Iran can be seen as a short-term victory for the foreign policy hawks in the Republican Party, the OBBBA will give the isolationists the upper hand in the long run.ConclusionIn the end, this bill is essentially about extending the Trump tax cuts of 2017 and adding some new tax cuts promised during the presidential campaign of 2024. Despite spending cuts on clean energy programs and health care for low income Americans, the fiscal hawks saw their wings clipped again and the US public debt continues to rise. However, the foreign policy hawks are in for some big disappointments as well. They may be basking in the glory of the attack on Iran, but there is no budget for their future ambitions. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” underlines that these two traditional wings of the Republican Party, the fiscal hawks and the foreign policy hawks, have been pushed aside by the MAGA movement.

Mark Green, R- Tenn., announced his official resignation from Congress after voting for President Donald Trump’s megabill. He said he was starting a new business, but did not disclose specifics. His resignation could further shrink Republicans’ majority in the U.S. House, at least temporarily.Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., announced his official resignation from Congress on Friday, a move that was expected but one that could, at least for now, shrink Republicans’ already narrow majority in the House.“To my constituents across Tennessee’s 7th District—thank you. The trust you put in me is humbling. I will look back fondly on my years of serving as your voice in Washington,” Green wrote in a post on X.With his resignation, Republicans are down to a 219-212 majority in the House, at least until his seat in the solidly red district is filled.His resignation will be effective July 20, Fox News reports from a letter Green sent to House Republican leadership.Green’s resignation is a blow to House Speaker Mike Johnson’s already narrow majority in the lower chamber, a fact that was on stark display this week as he was trying to pass President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”Johnson struggled to coalesce his conference around the megabill, and the narrow majority gave him little wiggle room for defections. With Green’s resignation, Johnson’s could face an even more challenging road ahead.Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, said he was returning to the private sector to start his own business, but did not provide details about the business.“While I cannot give the details here, I will be doing something specifically designed to help America compete against the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], but this time in business,” Green said in a video on X.Green was elected to serve in Congress in 2018, succeeding Sen.

2025-07-05 15:05:00,"FBI, Sheriff's Office Arrest 28 Motorcycle Gang Members In 'Operation Mongolian Beef'","FBI, Sheriff's Office Arrest 28 Motorcycle Gang Members In 'Operation Mongolian Beef' Over two dozen alleged members of an outlaw motorcycle gang have been arrested and charged in connection with a March shooting at a Florida gas station, the FBI's Jacksonville office announced on Wednesday.In total, 28 members of the Mongols motorcycle gang were arrested during a joint operation, dubbed ""Operation Mongolian Beef,"" which was done in coordination between the FBI Jacksonville Division, the Volusia Sheriff's Office, and the Seventh Judicial Circuit State Attorney's Office, according to a statement, which added that arrest warrants were issued for three other members of the gang, whose arrests are pending.As the Epoch Times notes further, the individuals have been charged with aggravated rioting in relation to the shooting at a gas station in New Smyrna Beach during Bike Week on March 8, 2025.Aggravated rioting is when an individual participates in a riot of 25 or more other people, according to the statement. It is a second-degree felony and punishable by up to 15 years in prison.As part of the operation, the FBI and its law enforcement partners carried out 14 search warrants at multiple properties, including at the Mongols Clubhouse in Edgewater, Florida; four homes in Volusia County; three homes in Brevard County; two homes in Miami-Dade County; one home in Chesterfield County, Virginia; one home in Palm Beach County; and two homes in Polk County.“The FBI has made a commitment to all Americans that we will crush violent crime across the country,” FBI Jacksonville Special Agent in Charge Jason Carley said in the statement.“There is no doubt Volusia County and, in fact, the entire state of Florida is safer today with these violent offenders off the street.”The Mongols motorcycle gang, also known as the Mongols Motorcycle Club, is an international organization that self-identifies as an “outlaw” motorcycle gang, meaning its members define themselves as within the “1 percent” of motorcycle clubs who do not abide by the law, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).The group has slogans such as “Respect Few, Fear None” and “Live Mongol Die Mongol,” which the DOJ said illustrate the members’ “cut-throat attitude.”Its members typically wear vests and patches, or have tattoos identifying their connection to the group, the DOJ said.Outlaw motorcycle gangs are generally highly structured criminal organizations whose members engage in a range of criminal activities, including violent crime, weapons trafficking, and drug trafficking, according to the DOJ.The Mongols gang is one of many such outlaw gangs that pose a “serious national domestic threat,” the department said.Volusia Sheriff Mike Chitwood said the March 8 shooting took place at around 11.30 a.m, and involved members of the Mongols gang and a rival gang called the Warlocks.He said the Mongols knew in advance that the Warlocks would be at the gas station and planned to “attack them.”The Mongols arrived at the gas station and fired at the rival gang members, Chitwood said at a press conference, adding that “bullets were flying, innocent people were there, children were there.”Two Warlocks were shot and sustained minor injuries, Chitwood said.They declined to cooperate with law enforcement, but officials were able to use video footage from the shooting, including footage taken by bystanders, to identify at least 31 individuals allegedly involved in the incident, he said.Chitwood said the Mongols are recognized as an organized crime domestic terror group in the United States, and internationally.“They lit the fuse,” he said of the group. “It’s game on now. It’s game on because there’s going to be a treasure trove of evidence that’s going to lead to more and more indictments and arrests and put all the motorcycle gangers on notice.” Tyler DurdenSat, 07/05/2025 - 11:05",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/political/fbi-sheriffs-office-arrest-28-motorcycle-gang-members-operation-mongolian-beef,business,

2025-07-05 14:30:00,Columbia To Pay $9 Million To Settle Lawsuit Over US News College Ranking Data,"Columbia To Pay $9 Million To Settle Lawsuit Over US News College Ranking Data Authored by Katabella Roberts via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),Columbia University has agreed to pay $9 million to settle a proposed class-action lawsuit by a former student who claimed the school submitted inaccurate data to U.S. News & World Report, artificially inflating its position in the publication’s annual ranking of American universities.The main campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 12, 2025. Caitlin Ochs/ReutersIn a statement to The Epoch Times, a university spokesperson said Columbia did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the agreement and is entering into the settlement to “avoid protracted and costly litigation.”“Columbia University has reached a settlement agreement regarding the alleged misreporting of data to U.S. News & World Report in connection with its Best Colleges rankings,” the spokesperson said.The settlement covers about 22,000 undergraduate students at Columbia College, Columbia Engineering, and Columbia’s School of General Studies who were enrolled from the fall of 2016 to the spring of 2022, the spokesperson said.“While the University denies any wrongdoing, it deeply regrets deficiencies in prior reporting and has adopted new steps to improve the quality and accuracy of information available to prospective students,” the spokesperson added. “Since 2022, the University has published Common Data Sets for all three undergraduate schools which are reviewed by a well-established, independent advisory firm to ensure reporting accuracy.”The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed against Columbia’s Board of Trustees in August 2022 by a former student who accused the university of misrepresenting some of the data it submitted to U.S. News & World Report’s (USNWR’s) annual list.According to the complaint, Columbia’s USNWR ranking has steadily risen from 18th place in 1988 to 2nd place in 2022 through the reporting of false data.The lawsuit stated that USNWR’s yearly college rankings are popular with the general public and influence university application patterns. It further said the publication relies on universities, including Columbia, to self-report the data, which is then used to determine the universities’ rankings.In March 2022, Michael Thaddeus, a professor of mathematics at Columbia, published an article concluding that the university had misreported data to USNWR.The lawsuit said that Thaddeus found, among other things, that Columbia reported to USNWR that 82.5 percent of undergraduate classes enroll fewer than 20 students, which marked a higher percentage than any other school in the top 100 USNWR rankings.His analysis of data from Columbia’s Directory of Classes indicated that the correct figure was likely between 62.7 percent and 66.9 percent, the lawsuit said.Columbia also told USNWR that 8.9 percent of undergraduate classes enroll 50 students or more, but an analysis of data from Columbia’s Directory of Classes indicated that figure was more likely between 10.6 percent and 12.4 percent, according to the lawsuit.The university also told the publication that 96.5 percent of its non-medical faculty are full-time, but the analysis by Thaddeus found that the correct figure was likely 74.1 percent. It also reported that its student-faculty ratio is 6:1, but Thaddeus found it was likely 11:1.The lawsuit stated that Colombia’s actions were “objectively false, misleading and deceptive.” They also led to students paying “premiums for tuition, fees and costs based, in material part, upon Columbia’s USNWR ranking,” according to the lawsuit.It alleged breach of contract, unjust enrichment, common law fraud, and violation of New York General Business Law.In September 2022, the university said that it had “previously relied on outdated and/or incorrect methodologies” for some of the data it had submitted to USNWR and said it had changed those methodologies for current and future data submissions.Then-Provost Mary Boyce said in a statement that “anything less than complete accuracy in the data that we report—regardless of the size or the reason—is inconsistent with the standards of excellence to which Columbia holds itself.”“We deeply regret the deficiencies in our prior reporting and are committed to doing better,” Boyce added.In June 2023, Columbia said its undergraduate schools would stop submitting data to the U.S. News rankings, saying it remained “concerned with the role that rankings have assumed in the undergraduate application process.”It said the rankings appeared to have an outsized influence on prospective students and may “distill a university’s profile into a composite of data categories.” Tyler DurdenSat, 07/05/2025 - 10:30",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/political/columbia-pay-9-million-settle-lawsuit-over-us-news-college-ranking-data,business,

2025-07-05 15:00:02,"You voted for budget cuts. Why are you crying now, Alaska?","Two ​​Alaskan lawmakers—including one Republican and one independent—just published a hand-wringing op-ed in The New York Times warning that the GOP’s latest budget reconciliation bill will throw their state into chaos. The headline? “Alaska cannot survive this bill.”The list of horrors is long: Nearly 40,000 Alaskans will lose their health coverage, tens of thousands will go hungry as SNAP benefits are slashed, rural clinics and grocery stores will disappear, schools will be defunded, and entire communities will be left to fend for themselves.All of it is true. And all of it is the direct result of the agenda that Alaska voted for.GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is scrambling to shield her state from the very law her constituents voted for.President Donald Trump campaigned on gutting the federal government—slashing Medicaid, killing food assistance, ending clean energy tax credits, and defunding agencies that keep rural America afloat. More than 54% of Alaskans voted for him in 2024 anyway.This isn’t new. Red states have long depended on the very federal programs that their politicians vow to destroy. When Trump cuts the Federal Emergency Management Agency, it’s the governors of red states who panic. When Medicaid is attacked, it’s rural hospitals in deep-red counties that go under. With SNAP on the chopping block, red states suffer the most. West Virginia, for example, has 16% of its population on food stamps.And through it all, blue states keep footing the bill—only to be smeared as “socialist” for insisting that the government should actually help people.In fact, the small-government crowd is the most dependent on assistance from the government. The same politicians who rail against handouts suddenly demand carveouts when the axe swings their way—like Sen. Lisa Murkowski scrambling to shield Alaska from the very law her constituents voted for. It’s a pattern, and it’s getting old.In their op-ed, the authors warn that “Alaska cannot afford to lose health care funding,” citing the state’s high rates of suicide, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections, along with a dire shortage of behavioral health services. The kicker? They claim that the GOP cuts “will only make these problems worse,” as if Alaska is uniquely burdened with public health crises and therefore deserves a permanent federal subsidy while voting to deny one to everyone else.Apparently, when it’s a red state in trouble, the government needs to step in. Immediately. With cash from blue states, who get nothing but scorn in return.The community welcome sign in Girdwood, AlaskaAlaska receives more federal money per capita than almost any other state. More than 40% of its state budget is federally funded, one-third of Alaskans is on Medicaid, and more than 70,000 rely on SNAP—about 10% of the population. That funding comes overwhelmingly from blue states like California, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Washington—states that vote for a functioning government.So, yes, Alaska is right to be scared. The bill will devastate them. But they aren’t innocent. They helped build the wrecking ball—and now they’re shocked to find it swinging in their direction. Actions have consequences.“What is the end game here? How does it help anyone to terminate health care coverage for our most vulnerable through red tape or take away food for families who have limited to no options for gainful employment?” the op-ed says.Great questions. You know who’s not trying to do any of that? Democrats.If this bill passes and the lights start going out in Alaska, there will be no confusion about who flipped the switch.Trump’s DOJ is targeting Daily Kos.

2025-07-05 14:12:54,PHOTO: SUV crashes into pool on Cape Cod,"Former Chicago White Sox closer Bobby Jenks has died at the age of 44 after a battle against a terminal form of stomach cancer.Jenks, who won a World Series championship with the White Sox in 2005, had been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma earlier this year, and passed away Friday in Portugal, the White Sox announced in a press release.“We have lost an iconic member of the White Sox family today,” said White Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. “None of us will ever forget that ninth inning of Game 4 in Houston, all that Bobby did for the 2005 World Series champions and for the entire Sox organization during his time in Chicago. He and his family knew cancer would be his toughest battle, and he will be missed as a husband, father, friend and teammate. He will forever hold a special place in all our hearts.”Jenks spoke to The Athletic about being diagnosed with Stage 4 stomach cancer earlier this year, which came just weeks after his southern California home burned down in the Palisades Fire in the Los Angeles area in January.“I’ve come to the realization that it could be six months, or it could be three years,” he said in an interview with The Athletic. “But I’m ready. And however long it takes, I’m going to be here fighting it.”He made his MLB debut with the White Sox during the remarkable 2005 season, with six saves and a 2.75 ERA during the regular season. He was especially critical in the playoffs, racking up four more saves and closing out the final game of the World Series, which gave the team their first title in 88 years.Jenks had 173 saves during six seasons with the White Sox. Jenks is survived by his wife Eleni Tzitzivacos, their two children, Zeno and Kate and his four children from a prior marriage, Cuma, Nolan, Rylan and Jackson, according to the White Sox.",necn,https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/harwich-suv-pool/3759784/,politics,

It's not good. I wasn't happy with it"" - in reference to Putin.Via Sky NewsBut it should be remembered that the White House just days prior halted some shipments of defense aid, which speaks louder than words. European allies are predictably upset and Kiev is now dealing very carefully with Washington, and handling Trump with kid gloves, given it is in a precarious situation on the battlefield.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, announced Saturday that his latest conversation with Trump this week was the best and ""most productive"" he has ever had.""Regarding the conversation with the president of the United States, which took place a day earlier, it was probably the best conversation we have had during this whole time, the most productive,"" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.""We discussed air defense issues and I'm grateful for the willingness to help. The Patriot system is precisely the key to protection against ballistic threats,"" he added.Zelensky has also been asking Washington to slap more sanctions on Moscow, something Trump has so far resisted in order to give better space for peace negotiations to take off.Asked by reporters over whether Zelensky's request for more Patriot missiles would be honored, Trump replied, ""They're going to need them for defense... They're going to need something because they're being hit pretty hard.""Trump had further said of the Zelensky call, which happened Friday, ""We talked about different things... I think it was a very, very strategic call.""This suggests that some new decision-making could be afoot regarding supplying Ukraine. There have been recent reports, however, that Trump is prioritizing defense of Israel, even diverting arms and ammo away from eastern Europe for that purpose. Trump has been expressing deep frustration at lack of momentum in US-backed peace efforts, for which he's criticized both warring sides.

2025-07-06 16:50:00,Tchir: The Risk For Stocks Is That The Administration Decides It Was Correct All Along On Tariffs,"Tchir: The Risk For Stocks Is That The Administration Decides It Was Correct All Along On Tariffs By Peter Tchir of Academy SecuritiesBig, Beautiful Production For SecurityThe “Big Beautiful Bill” is now law (which always brings back childhood memories of Schoolhouse Rock – yes, we had that in Canada too). If you don’t know the “I’m Just a Bill” song it is well worth a quick search.We are taking the view that the new tax law is a big positive for the economy and markets.Yes, we can all argue who benefited the most and who got hurt by the bill. We can worry about the deficit. The law is probably far from anyone’s ideal vision of a “perfect” law, but we don’t think that is the main point.It is too early to worry about some “calculated” deficit that would occur over several years, under certain sets of conditions, that may or may not occur.Also, we will continue to highlight the Tariff Revenue Chart, which is adding real revenue for the Treasury and is NOT included in the CBO projections.A bill, passed by the House and Senate, and signed into law by the President, is a big deal. We can now plan. So far, much of what has been driving the economy and markets has relied on Executive Orders. While Executive Orders are useful, we have seen how easily they can be changed or even challenged in court. This law gives us certainty for many important aspects of the economy for at least the next 4 years. Maybe we should focus more on the details, as the “devil is in the details,” but this time, that might be “missing the forest for the trees.” What it says is less important than the fact that it now exists. Some degree of uncertainty for the economy has been removed.From what we can tell, it seems that some of the growth-oriented benefits are front-loaded. To the extent that plays out, it will help propel the economy in the near-term.Peace through Strength seems to be holding with the ceasefire in the Middle East and NATO increasing their spending.Both of these developments (the new tax law and renewed respect on the military front) should help unleash some Animal Spirits in the Economy. The markets have had no shortage of Animal Spirits, but that does not seem to be entirely the case with the economy.The Jobs Data was better than we expected (and what virtually every other economist was expecting), and as we described in that report, it was more consistent than prior reports. Having said that, there are some things to quibble about, but all that can change if we really start to reignite the Animal Spirts, which the administration seems to be doing.One Eye on TariffsThe July 9th date is rapidly approaching and there are indications that the “extension” of the “pause” may not be a given. It makes me very nervous that my social media stream is FULL of people mocking anyone who was afraid of tariffs. “Record highs despite the tariffs,” scream report after report. Hmmm.Let’s not forget that the stock market rally started when we “paused” tariffs from levels that seemed insanely high and based on “dubious” (to be extremely polite) logic. 10% on most of the world, with China at 35%, wasn’t much worse than where many thought we were headed – reciprocal tariffs. We continue to highlight the wide variety of tariff mitigation strategies being employed which are also softening any blow. But it is disingenuous to claim the “tariff policy” worked and the bears “missed it.”The President backing down on tariffs is what allowed for the rally.Since then, we’ve had the tax law and Peace through Strength, which are additional positives.The spending on AI continues unabated as companies crave efficiency, whether or not the economy is doing well.We only mention this as there does seem to be some risk that the administration will decide to take “another bite at the apple” on tariffs. That seems like the biggest risk to the market in the coming days. That we go back to some policy that employs tariffs at levels that will not be manageable. That risk is increasing as the number of victory laps on tariff policy is growing. Finally, that Tariff Chart we mentioned, which is bringing in revenue, also shows that very little money, relative to the size of the economy, has been spent on tariffs so far, so it is too early to judge (even at the “pause” rates) what the impact will be on the economy.Finally, while “sectoral” tariffs have dropped from the headlines, some tail risk remains with those (depending on how the administration decides to use them). It seems that the more formal process in place for these reduces any tail risk, but it is another thing on the tariff front that seems to have more downside than upside, given how comfortable markets are.National Production for National SecurityIf I thought it was intimidating being in London with Admiral Sir George Zambellas (former First Sea Lord and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports), it was about to get even more intimidating.We finished our London trip as part of the keynote address of an event held by Q15. Katy Martin of the FT moderated a panel with me and Baroness Dambisa Moyo, who had to zoom in as there was an urgent matter being debated in the House of Lords. She also serves on the boards of Chevron and Starbucks.Despite our dramatically different backgrounds (and degrees of success) we seemed to reach similar conclusions on the concept of National Production for National Security. We get to similar conclusions (described somewhat differently, but close enough for these purposes) via different processes. To me, that makes it resonate even more.The U.S. is not the only country that needs to be taking steps toward figuring out what is required for a “no fail” state and then doing something to ensure that this occurs.Not every country needs to be (or can be) isolated for all of its needs. Even some crucial necessities will require trade. But the more that can be done with allies, or friends, or even just countries in close proximity, the better. It is, as we’ve seen, easy for “adversaries” to use your critical needs to your disadvantage. Even allies, who might not do it on purpose, could face unforeseen events for themselves that limit their ability to continue to trade as before.My fervent hope is that the administration dedicates as much time and energy to this pursuit as possible. Ideally shifting away from tariffs as the main tool to get domestic growth higher and focusing on DEREGULATION and Targeted Spending to really jumpstart these efforts.We have seen some things done on the semiconductor side, and apparently on the steel side (not sure if the things being done regarding steel will turn out to be useful, but it is out there).Yet there doesn’t seem to be the urgency I would expect.The latest trade negotiations with China scream:We are at risk of being held hostage by processed and refined rare earths and critical minerals.Academy has been writing about this for years: Rare Earths - a National Security Threat was published back in February 2021 – and yet, it still feels like the nation is in its infancy with regards to overcoming this risk.DEREGULAITON can go a long way. As a property developer this seems like it is in the President’s Wheelhouse. The Commerce Secretary also seems well suited for this battle. We have imposed regulation after regulation over the years. The question is whether all these regulations make sense in an era where we are in direct competition with China. The U.S. had the luxury of being the sole superpower for decades, so it is valid (even necessary) to revisit a lot of things now that we must look at global competition from a different perspective.We may need to spend money. Offer contracts. Take a variety of financial initiatives (beyond some things like accelerated depreciation in the newly passed tax law) to get these industries that are important for national security (chips, medicines, certain commodities, etc.) to grow as rapidly as we may need them to grow. While deregulation is definitively in the Trump playbook, it is less clear that this is. However, we look back to Bessent’s “three legged stool” analogy, where he seems to realize it and may be able to help on that front while others tackle deregulation.We cannot hammer home the point enough that refined and processed commodities are at the forefront of our fear. We usually get some “snickers” when we point out that oil is useless. And yes, the statement is designed to illicit that response, but the reality is that Gasoline and Diesel are extremely useful, but oil in its raw (or crude) form is just not that useful in everyday life. Again, yes, the statement is a bit over the top, but it is meant to get people really thinking about what we need - and that is the refined (or processed) versions of commodities. We’ve lamented that many reports indicate that 90% of the oil released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was sent outside the country to be refined.Yes, getting access to rare earths and critical minerals is important, but if you cannot process them or refine them yourselves, you are leaving the most important step to someone else – in this case China. It depends on the specific commodity, but using AI, it seems fair to say that somewhere between 80% and 90% of mission critical materials for “things” we need (on many fronts) is still controlled by China.We don’t need to be able to procure and refine every last ounce of what we use, but we are so far from that, and we need to take urgent steps as the lack of processing and refining is becoming a very visible weakness (and not just in the U.S. but also in many other major countries, who have possibly been “too comfortable” to do some of the “heavy lifting” that they really need to do).It is a good time to paraphrase one of my favorite lines from COVID. I believe it was the CEO of Whirlpool who said something to the effect of “a product that is 99% done, is still not done.” Just think about that statement in the context of where we are with respect to many rare earths, critical minerals, semiconductors, medicines, etc.Bottom LineA focus on national production for national security (something every country needs to be thinking about) would go a long way to supporting the economic momentum delivered by the tax law and rejuvenated defense posture of the United States.The risk is that the administration decides it was correct all along on tariffs and that we see more “Big Beautiful Tariff” policies in the coming days and weeks as we near some deadlines.Markets seem “ahead” of the economy, which is fine if we continue to put forth policies that encourage the economy to catch up. We seem to be on the right path for “Animal Spirits” to rise within the economy, but not if there is a renewed focus on tariffs.It should be another interesting week and hope you are all having a great 4th of July weekend!

2025-07-06 15:40:00,UK Restores Formal Diplomatic Ties With Syria After Grooming Sharaa For Power,"UK Restores Formal Diplomatic Ties With Syria After Grooming Sharaa For Power Via The CradleBritain reestablished full diplomatic relations with Syria on Sunday as part of the visit of UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy to Damascus to meet the country's new de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa (Jolani).In a video message on X, Lammy claimed the UK had an interest in Syria's recovery after 14 years of war. ""It matters that it's stable, because if it's not, the terrorism that can happen here washes up on our own streets back at home,"" he said.Image: FCDOHe also stressed the importance of addressing illegal immigration, noting that ""it's hugely important we continue to support progress here.""""This is a country that is ancient, made up of many different people. The future has to be an inclusive one. It has to be a peaceful one. And I hope for prosperity for all of the Syrian people,"" he said.Britain played a key role in sparking the war in Syria in 2011, which killed hundreds of thousands, and in bringing the current government, led by Sharaa, to power in December 2024.Sharaa previously fought for the Islamic State of Iraq (the precursor to ISIS) after the 2003 US invasion. He was detained in Iraq in 2006 and released by US officials in 2008.After his release, Sharaa was appointed head of Islamic State operations in Mosul Province, dispatching suicide car bombers to kill Shia Muslims and Christians. In August 2011, he was dispatched to Syria by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to establish the Nusra Front.That same year, UK intelligence facilitated the travel of British extremists of Libyan and West and South Asian backgrounds to Syria to fight against the government of Bashar al-Assad. Many joined the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front and ISIS.The same year, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, founded the NGO Inter Mediate, a Foreign Office-funded project aimed at establishing secret channels with insurgent groups. He boasted that his group worked closely with the UK foreign office and UK intelligence. Powell personally met multiple times with Sharaa in Idlib Governorate in an effort to rebrand his terrorist image and groom him as Syria's next leader.The Nusra Front was later rebranded as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Sharaa and HTS captured Damascus in December, ousting Assad.Syrian analyst Malek Hafez told the Syrian Observer that Powell, who became UK National Security Advisor in November, has a team running a media office inside the presidential palace, ""reportedly run by two women – one British, the other of Lebanese-British heritage.""As Hafez concludes, ""The rise of Ahmad al-Sharaa was not spontaneous – it was carefully engineered through a long-term, western-backed strategy, in which Britain played a disproportionately influential role among western powers.""Here is the British Foreign Secretary David Lammy meeting with the head and founder of the (still) proscribed organisation Hayʾat Tahrīr al‐Shām (HTS) in Damascus today.I trust Lammy will be arrested at Heathrow on his return to London, right @TerrorismPolice @metpoliceuk? pic.twitter.com/5nspEUY6JO— Naila (@BrownNaila) July 5, 2025Since Assad's fall, Syria has moved toward becoming an extremist Islamic state based on the violent ideology of the medieval Islamic scholar Ibn Taymiyyah.In March, extremist Islamist gunmen affiliated with Syria's Ministry of Defense and General Security massacred at least 1,500 Alawite civilians, often referring to them as pigs and dogs before killing them.

While Bessent dismissed the notion that August 1 represents a fresh deadline, he acknowledged that the new date could allow trading partners additional time to renegotiate tariff terms.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 is set to open lower with futures tied to the benchmark at 8,583 compared to its last close of 8,603.Futures for Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stood at 23,899, lower than its last close of 23,916.06.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was set to open higher, with the futures contract in Chicago at 39,915 against the index’s last close of 39,810.88.The Reserve Bank of Australia kicks start its two-day meeting, where it is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points to 3.60%.U.S. stock futures fell after Trump confirmed that tariffs are set to go into effect Aug. 1, not July 9. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid by 146 points, or 0.32%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.39% and 0.42%, respectively.Last Friday stateside, the three major averages closed higher. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average powered to new highs and capped off a winning week as banking behemoths ushered in a promising start to the third-quarter earnings season. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.33% to finish at 18,342.94 and less than 2% below its all-time high.— CNBC’s Samantha Subin and Brian Evans contributed to this report.Trump confirms that tariffs will go into effect Aug. 1U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that tariffs will go into effect Aug. 1, not July 9. Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were asked in an interview with reporters Sunday to clarify when tariffs are set to go into effect. Lutnick responded, “Tariffs go into effect Aug. 1. But the president is setting the rates, and the deals, right now.” Trump assented with the statement. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” that tariffs announced back in April will go into effect on Aug. 1 for those countries that have yet to reach an agreement with the U.S. He said duties will “boomerang” back to April 2 levels if there is no progress.— Sarah Min",nbcsandiego,https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/business/money-report/stock-futures-fall-after-trump-says-tariffs-to-go-into-effect-aug-1-not-july-9-live-updates/3862653/,business,

2025-07-06 17:09:12,Bessent casts some shade over Musk's new political party,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday he imagined that Elon Musk's businesses' boards weren't so keen on the Tesla CEO's unveiling of his new ""America Party.""The big picture: The world's richest man — who before his explosive fallout with President Trump said he'd do a lot less political spending moving forward — became a GOP mega-donor last year. Now, the billionaire seems intent on carving a new political path.Irate over Trump's recently signed ""big, beautiful bill,"" the former DOGE leader is turning his sights away from what he described as ""the two-party (some would say uniparty) system"" and plans to form his own party.Driving the news: Bessent, with whom Musk once had a heated spat in the White House, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that ""the principles of DOGE were very popular"" — but Musk was not.Musk's massive slashes through the federal government left a bruise on his reputation and his company.A March NBC News poll found that 46% of voters thought creating DOGE was a good idea, while 40% said it was bad — but when asked to broadly rate their feelings on DOGE, 47% had a negative view, compared to 41% who held a positive view. And 51% had a negative view of Musk himself.What he's saying: ""I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies, which he is better at than anyone,"" Bessent told CNN's Dana Bash.He continued, ""I imagine that those boards of directors did not like this announcement yesterday, and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.""Catch up quick: Musk announced on Saturday that he would launch ""the America Party,"" which he claimed would ""give you back your freedom.""Musk said in a response that the party would caucus independently and that ""legislative discussions would be had with both parties."" Yes, but: There are steps Musk must take to formally register a political party, and recent Federal Election Commission filings don't show that has yet happened. What we're watching: The day prior, he shared a poll to his followers asking whether he should create a new political party and suggested part of his strategy would be to ""laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts."" Musk didn't specify what those specific races would be.He added, ""Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people.""Billionaire Mark Cuban and Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly worked in for Trump during his first term, both appeared interested.

2025-07-06 17:00:12,Trained volunteers patrol LA streets as ICE raids intensify,"Neighborhood groups monitor immigration enforcement amid rising fear and federal scrutiny.By Myriam-Fernanda Alcala Delgado for Capital & MainThe day after families across the country gathered to celebrate Father’s Day, Francisco Romero huddled at dawn with 10 volunteers in a South Los Angeles parking lot. The group was preparing to patrol the neighborhood for signs of Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity.There was a heaviness in the atmosphere, despite the comradery and smiles. During the group huddle, some reflected on the difficulty celebrating Father’s Day while families across the city were being separated by ICE. Another volunteer mentioned viral videos from the prior weekend showing apparent ICE presence in the nearby city of Bell, including “snatch and grabs,” in which unmarked vehicles surrounded pedestrians suspected of being undocumented and ICE officers pulled them inside.“It’s psychological,” Romero said, speculating about the timing of the raids, which coincided with a holiday meant to celebrate family.Related | Noem wants to hunt down people who warn others about nearby ICE agentsWhile L.A. residents — and much of the country — were transfixed for days by images of masked officers rounding up immigrants and protesters flooding downtown streets, this quieter, grassroots effort to protect vulnerable communities from these raids has continued to unfold. Volunteers like Romero patrol the streets across Los Angeles weekly, keeping watch with the aim of alerting the community to any ICE operations.Such patrols are nothing new. Since the civil unrest that erupted after the beating of Rodney King in 1992, Unión del Barrio has operated community patrol networks to monitor for law enforcement activity and other potential dangers to residents in neighborhoods across California. But the environment has become more treacherous in recent weeks. There has been an increase in ICE operations across the city, including masked officers detaining suspected undocumented immigrants from local stores, street shops and neighborhoods. Their enforcement actions have led to protests in Los Angeles and pushback from residents and organizers alike.In addition, Unión del Barrio — along with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights Los Angeles and the Party for Socialism and Liberation — has drawn the attention of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who alleged in a letter sent to the groups in mid-June that they are providing “logistical and financial resources” in support of civil unrest and “aiding and abetting criminal conduct.” The letter calls on the groups to “cease and desist” their operations.In response, Unión del Barrio said in a June 15 statement, “The objective of Mr. Hawley’s letter was to intimidate us and compel Unión del Barrio to stop organizing the self-defense of our communities.”Francisco Romero meets with Unión del Barrio volunteers in a South Los Angeles parking lot before heading out on patrol. Faces of volunteers who asked not to be identified have been obscured.Many volunteers, including Aimee and Ruth, never interact directly with ICE, while those who do, like Romero, follow a strict protocol meant to protect them from arrest while they carry out their work. When Romero spots what he believes might be an ICE vehicle, he first calls for backup from fellow organizers before deciding whether to approach. In the past, he would tap on the car window and ask the officer to identify themselves.“That was back when they would still roll down their windows. Now, they don’t,” he said.The atmosphere of heightened fear has caused the members of the group to use extra caution when describing their work and when approaching ICE agents. When speaking among themselves or with the broader community, they avoid language that suggests they are “chasing out” or “following” ICE operations. Instead, they describe their efforts as “safely monitoring” ICE activity from a distance. When agents leave a neighborhood, organizers say the agents are “electing to do so,” often because they have lost the element of surprise, according to Romero.The group has also gone to extra lengths to make sure community members are comfortable with their presence when they are on patrol. Each member of Unión del Barrio’s patrol wears a green shirt emblazoned with the group’s logo, so they are clearly recognizable. The volunteers are given magnets with the organization’s name to affix to the side of their cars. They travel in small groups. On this Monday in June, Francisco, Ruth and Aimee were assigned to patrol the residential neighborhoods north of Martin Luther King Boulevard. Aimee, who lives in the community, said she preferred to use only her first name for the safety of her friends and family; Ruth, a teacher, likewise asked that only her first name be used.Aimee, who has volunteered with Unión del Barrio for the past six months, was looking through the back seat window when she noticed a car with blacked out plates. Romero decided the car was suspicious enough to merit an investigation to see whether it belonged to ICE officers.The spotting of any car that is unmarked, has tinted windows or is deemed in any way out of the ordinary is enough to prompt the patrol team to turn back and retrace their steps.That particular car turned out not to be a threat. But just two hours after Romero, Aimee and Ruth’s patrol had finished for the morning, Unión del Barrio posted a warning on social media about ICE presence less than a mile away.Romero pulls over during an early morning ICE patrol to coordinate with other volunteer units.Unión del Barrio conducts two types of patrols: morning rides that monitor neighborhoods with large numbers of Latino residents or workers who may be targeted for immigration enforcement and patrols triggered by community tips about real-time ICE activity. The latter have become more frequent in recent weeks, as ICE operations have intensified. In both cases, the organization either verifies the activity directly or coordinates with trusted community members or other civil rights organizations before issuing public alerts on social media.Despite heightened scrutiny of immigrant rights organizations in recent weeks by federal officials, a growing number of community groups and individuals are seeking them out for guidance. Unión del Barrio has received calls from across the state and country from individuals and groups requesting resources on preparing communities for incursion by ICE. The organization is planning a trip across California to provide training to allied community groups over the course of the summer. Romero estimates interest in those trainings has tripled in the last few weeks. Instead of taking Sen. Hawley’s allegations as a deterrent, “We see it as a new front of struggle,” said Romero, who has been with Unión del Barrio for 30 years and got his start as an activist against police violence.Related | Here’s what’s happening to the people ICE arrests in immigration courtBut, according to Romero, ICE officers are altering their tactics to evade detection by community patrols. ICE used to commonly conduct operations in the morning but has now shifted its efforts to later in the day, when most patrol volunteers are working.Another ICE innovation is the use of decoys — in which a suspected ICE vehicle leads patrol cars one way while other ICE operations move elsewhere.Capital & Main reached out to ICE officials for comment for this story but received no response.* * *With about 15 minutes left of the patrol, Romero headed towards Santee Alley just as businesses start to open. Ruth, who was riding shotgun, explained how Unión del Barrio has done more than patrol the community. They have been offering training to community members for months, including on how to prepare a plan in case one of them is detained by ICE. “So we know how to respond when ICE inevitably attacks us again,” she said.Related | Now DHS is lying about scary immigrants with weed whackersRuth also shared her motivation for volunteering: She sees how ICE’s increased presence in the community over the last few weeks has impacted her students, whom she calls “her kids.” They are why she continues to patrol.Meanwhile, Romero was making a point that morning of staying within the speed limit and obeying traffic laws at every stop or turn. Sometimes, he said, he has the urge to “book it” to respond to an alert that ICE has been spotted. But he knows, now more than ever, that “any excuse to engage with us is an opportunity for them to break us.”Campaign Action",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/6/2331383/-Trained-volunteers-patrol-LA-streets-as-ICE-raids-intensify,politics,

2025-07-06 15:00:05,Daily Kos is moving to WordPress,"For most of its existence, Daily Kos has run on custom-built publishing platforms. That might’ve made sense a decade or two ago, but now it’s expensive, outdated, and difficult to maintain. Every small change or upgrade requires complex engineering work, even as the existing system demands constant upkeep. Just maintaining security patches has been a difficult process. New features have often been promised but rarely delivered. That’s on me—and yeah, it’s embarrassing.But starting now, everything changes.We’re officially migrating Daily Kos to WordPress—the world’s most popular and powerful open-source publishing platform, which powers major media outlets like The Nation, Time, Vogue, Variety, New York Post, Rolling Stone, Vox, Wired, and many more.Our current system has served us well, but it’s old, brittle, and costly. By moving to WordPress, we’ll unlock access to a vast ecosystem of tools, faster updates, and modern features. That means better usability, more time spent building what you actually want, and less time patching legacy code from as far back as 2004.I’ll have more to say about the migration in the weeks and months ahead, but this is truly game-changing. We’ll be able to tap into a huge library of community-enhancing plugins. Want account badges? There’s a plugin for that—no more months and months of custom dev work. Some of you would really like this plugin. We’ll have lots of options to choose from, depending on what we want to implement. We can even build an app without spinning up a separate, expensive team.All of this means a system that’s vastly easier to maintain and update. No more vague promises. No more spinning our wheels.We’ve partnered with an experienced outside vendor to build and launch the new Daily Kos. The initial scope is a straight port of the existing site, with a refreshed homepage layout. No bells or whistles—yet. But once we’re live, and with enough community support, we’ll be able to add all sorts of great new features quickly and affordably by leveraging the plugin library.While the timeline might shift depending on what we uncover during development, the vendor is confident we can launch early next year. You help shape what comes next.This isn’t just a migration. It’s an opportunity to rethink what Daily Kos can be—while staying true to our community roots.That’s why we are forming a new Community Advisory Group, which will work directly with the product and leadership teams to help initially guide:The features we prioritize for launch.The legacy tools we keep, cut, or evolve.What innovations we build next.I’ve written before about how the economics of media have transformed—in a good way. In the past, when email list-building and advertising made up two-thirds of our revenue, you were the product. Our customers were campaigns, agencies, and media buyers.Today, reader support and donations account for 80–90% of our revenue. That changes everything. Now we are the product, and you are the customer. That means we have to be fully responsive to your needs and priorities.So we’re not just switching platforms—we’re empowering the community to help shape the future of Daily Kos.We’re already inviting key community members—those who’ve demonstrated leadership in organizing and building this space—to join the advisory group. I’m genuinely thrilled to work with this new batch of pioneers. Like, so excited.Honestly, one of the most frustrating things about our current situation with the Justice Department is that I’d planned to spend this summer talking and scheming with you all about the next evolution of Daily Kos—and fundraising to make it happen. I hate to have to ask you again for support.But that’s part of the new revenue reality: You guys fund Daily Kos, and we also need your support to fund this migration. But it’s going to be so worth it. It’ll mean we can finally start delivering on the community’s long-standing wishlist—a wishlist you can define. This is the future we’ve been working toward: more flexibility, more innovation, and, most importantly, more collaboration with you, the community that’s kept this site alive and thriving for over two decades.In July and August, we’ll work with the advisory board and staff to decide what features we’ll carry over—and what we can let go. The less we port, the cheaper and faster the project will be. But nothing is gone forever! Thanks to WordPress, we can rebuild later, easily and affordably.And then? We’re off to the races—working with you to bring the tools and features we all want.You can help fund the project here",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/6/2331527/-Daily-Kos-is-moving-to-WordPress,politics,

""But I'm sure you've seen and heard a lot of the concern, including and especially from Republicans who are the most vocal in Congress, about the fact that those work requirements are going to be very cumbersome to actually prove.

Trump has said he preferred those letters to negotiations, after a three-month pause on his most sweeping tariffs netted three deals, rather than the 90 his administration promised. That pause expires this coming Wednesday.What they're saying: Bessent, in an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union,"" said the letters would make clear that absent a deal, the rates would return to the levels Trump announced April 2.""It's not a new deadline. We are saying, this is when it's happening, if you want to speed things up, have at it, if you want to go back to the old rate, that's your choice,"" he said.The intrigue: Even with the new date in play, Bessent said there will be significant activity in the coming hours, as countries scramble to get something done before the original deadline. ""We are close to several deals. As always, there's a lot of foot-dragging on the other side,"" he said. ""I would expect to see several big announcements over the next couple of days.""What to watch: Trump's letter threat risks re-igniting the tariff chaos that crushed CEO and consumer confidence earlier this year and sent financial markets plunging. Stocks have since rebounded to new record highs, consumer sentiment has improved and bond markets have taken a deep breath — all of which could be at risk if the trade war heats back up.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/06/trump-tariffs-letters-trade-war,politics,

2025-07-07 15:50:36,‘Big beautiful bill' may help some seniors on Social Security. But it doesn't eliminate taxes on benefits,"One of the most popular gaming YouTubers is named Bloo, but he isn’t a human — he’s a VTuber, a fully virtual personality powered by artificial intelligence. VTubers first gained traction in Japan in the 2010s. Now, advances in AI are making it easier than ever to create VTubers, fueling a new wave of virtual creators on YouTube. As AI-generated content becomes more common online, concerns about its impact are growing, especially as it becomes easier to generate convincing but entirely AI-fabricated videos.One of the most popular gaming YouTubers is named Bloo and has bright blue wavy hair and dark blue eyes. But he isn’t a human — he’s a fully virtual personality powered by artificial intelligence.“I’m here to keep my millions of viewers worldwide entertained and coming back for more,” Bloo said in an interview with CNBC. “I’m all about good vibes and engaging content. I’m built by humans, but boosted by AI.”Bloo is a virtual YouTuber, or VTuber, who has built a massive following of 2.5 million subscribers and more than 700 million views through videos of him playing popular games like Grand Theft Auto, Roblox and Minecraft. VTubers first gained traction in Japan in the 2010s. Now, advances in AI are making it easier than ever to create VTubers, fueling a new wave of virtual creators on YouTube.The virtual character — whose bright colors and 3D physique look like something out of a Pixar film or the video game Fortnite — was created by Jordi van den Bussche, a longtime YouTuber also known as kwebbelkop. Van den Bussche, a 29-year-old who lives in Amsterdam, said he created Bloo after finding himself unable to keep up with the demands of content creation. The work no longer matched the output.“Turns out, the flaw in this equation is the human, so we need to somehow remove the human,” van den Bussche said in an interview. “The only logical way was to replace the human with either a photorealistic person or a cartoon. The VTuber was the only option, and that’s where Bloo came from.”Bloo has already generated more than seven figures in revenue, according to van den Bussche. Many VTubers such as Bloo are “puppeteered,” meaning a human controls the character’s voice and movements in real time using motion capture or face-tracking technology. Everything else on Bloo’s channel, from video thumbnails to voice dubbing in other languages, is handled by AI technology from ElevenLabs, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude. Van den Bussche’s long-term goal is for Bloo’s entire personality and content creation process to be run by AI.Van den Bussche has already tested fully AI-generated videos on Bloo’s channel but said the results have not yet been promising. The content doesn’t perform as well because the AI still lacks the intuition and creative instincts of a human, he said. “When AI can do it better, faster or cheaper than humans, that’s when we’ll start using it permanently,” van den Bussche said.The technology might not be far away.Startup Hedra offers a product that uses AI technology to generate videos that are up to five minutes long. It raised $32 million in a funding round in May led by Andreessen Horowitz’s Infrastructure fund.Hedra’s product, Character-3, allows users to create AI-generated characters for videos and can add dialogue and other characteristics. CEO Michael Lingelbach told CNBC that Hedra is working on a product that will allow users to create self-sustaining, fully automated characters.HedraHedra’s product Character-3 allows users to make figures powered by AI that can be animated in real-time.“We’re doing a lot of research accelerating models like Character-3 to real time, and that’s going to be a really good fit for VTubers,” Lingelbach said. Character-3’s technology is already being used by a growing number of creators who are experimenting with new formats, and many of their projects are going viral. One of those is comedian Jon Lajoie’s Talking Baby Podcast, which features a hyper-realistic animated baby talking into a microphone. Another is Milla Sofia, a virtual singer and artist whose AI-generated music videos attract thousands of views. Source: Instagram | Talking Baby PodcastTalking Baby PodcastThese creators are using Character-3 to produce content that stands out on social media, helping them reach wide audiences without the cost and complexity of traditional production.AI-generated video is a rapidly evolving technology that is reshaping how content is made and shared online, making it easier than ever to produce high-quality video without cameras, actors or editing software. In May, Google announced Veo 3, a tool that creates AI-generated videos with audio.Google said it uses a subset of YouTube content to train Veo 3, CNBC reported in June. While many creators said they were unaware of the training, experts said it has the potential to create an intellectual property crisis on the platform.Faceless AI YouTubersCreators are increasingly finding profitable ways to capitalize on the generative AI technology ushered in by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.One growing trend is the rise of faceless AI channels. These are run by creators who use these tools to produce videos with artificially generated images and voiceover that can sometimes earn thousands of dollars a month without them ever appearing on camera.“My goal is to scale up to 50 channels, though it’s getting harder because of how YouTube handles new channels and trust scores,” said a Spain-based creator who goes by the name GoldenHand and who declined to disclose his real name.Working with a small team, GoldenHand publishes up to 80 videos per day across his network of channels, he said. Some maintain a steady few thousand views per video while others might suddenly go viral and rack up millions of views, mostly to an audience of those over the age of 65.GoldenHand said his content is audio-driven storytelling. He described his YouTube videos as audiobooks that are paired with AI-generated images and subtitles. Everything after the initial idea is created entirely by AI, he said.He recently launched a new platform, TubeChef, which gives creators access to his system to automatically generate faceless AI videos starting at $18 a month.“People think using AI means you’re less creative, but I feel more creative than ever,” he said. “Coming up with 60 to 80 viral video ideas a day is no joke. The ideation is where all the effort goes now.”AI slopAs AI-generated content becomes more common online, concerns about its impact are growing. Some users worry about the spread of misinformation, especially as it becomes easier to generate convincing but entirely AI-fabricated videos.“Even if the content is informative and someone might find it entertaining or useful, I feel we are moving into a time where ... you do not have a way to understand what is human-made and what is not,” said Henry Ajder, founder of Latent Space Advisory, which helps businesses navigate the AI landscape.Others are frustrated by the sheer volume of low-effort AI content flooding their feeds. This kind of material is often referred to as “AI slop” — low-quality, randomly generated content made using artificial intelligence. Courtesy: Google DeepMindGoogle DeepMind Veo 3. “The age of slop is inevitable,” said Ajder, who is also an AI policy advisor at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. “I’m not sure what we do about it.”While it’s not new, the surge in this type of content has led to growing criticism from users who say it’s harder to find meaningful or original material, particularly on apps such as TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.“I am actually so tired of AI slop,” said one user on X. “AI images are everywhere now. There is no creativity and no effort in anything relating to art, video, or writing when using AI. It’s disappointing.”However, creators of such AI content told CNBC that it comes down to supply and demand. As the AI-generated content continues to get clicks, there’s no reason to stop creating more of it, said Noah Morris, a creator with 18 faceless YouTube channels.Some argue that AI videos still have inherent artistic value, and though it’s become much easier to create, slop-like content has always existed on the internet, Lingelbach said.“There’s never been a barrier to people making uninteresting content,” he said. “Now there’s just more opportunity to create different kinds of uninteresting content, but also more kinds of really interesting content too.”",nbcphiladelphia,https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/big-beautiful-bill-may-help-some-seniors-on-social-security-but-it-doesnt-eliminate-taxes-on-benefits/4228077/,business,

2025-07-07 15:40:00,Luxury Housing Market No Longer Out Of Reach For Some 'Move-Up' Buyers: Report,"Luxury Housing Market No Longer Out Of Reach For Some 'Move-Up' Buyers: Report Authored by Mary Prenon via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),Many people recall the Emmy Award–winning sitcom “The Jeffersons,” whose theme song references George and Weezie “moving on up.” Today, that trend is making a comeback in the luxury market, as “move-up” buyers are entering it for the first time.ppa/ShutterstockColdwell Banker’s 2025 Mid-Year Global Luxury Report indicates the U.S. luxury home market remains strong, with more buyers whose significant financial gains on the sales of their current homes are pushing them into a new level of home-buying opportunities.In preparing the report, the national real estate brokerage analyzed luxury market data from 120 U.S. markets and surveyed more than 200 of their luxury-property specialists to identify five current trends shaping this market segment.“Buyers who once thought luxury was out of reach are now finding themselves in that tier by default,” Michael Altneu, vice president of the Coldwell Banker Global Luxury Program, said in the report.“They’re coming to the market with significant equity and high expectations, and they’re helping to sustain activity.”This group includes homeowners who purchased properties five or more years ago and have made significant gains on their real estate investments.According to Realtor.com, the threshold prices for the luxury home market vary from state to state, with a low of $750,000 in West Virginia, to a high of $5.49 million in New York.Elena Novak, a lead real estate researcher analyst at PropertyChecker.com, told The Epoch Times that the trend of “move up” buyers is real and growing.“This is mostly due to record-high home equity, and many are putting their money toward larger homes, often in cash or with very small mortgages,” she said, citing an earlier report by data company ATTOM that notes U.S. home sellers in 2024 made an average profit of $122,500 per sale.However, Novak cautioned that the housing ladder is getting stuck.“While these buyers do help free up some mid-range homes, many other homeowners are staying put because they don’t want to give up their low mortgage rates,” she said. “This limits supply for first-time and middle-income buyers.”Novak believes that the effect of this “move up” trend will be mostly positive for the local economy.“A move-up buyer means two homes are sold, their old one and the new one [they bought], and that creates more spending, more local jobs, and more tax income,” she said.She believes the trend is also helping to keep the high-end market healthy, particularly in migration areas like the Sun Belt.Shaun Michael Lewis, CEO of Clearwater Properties, agrees, adding that the trend is equally as popular in the West.“Buyers who five years ago might have secured a modest $400,000 house in Bozeman, Montana, are now sitting on perhaps $600,000, $700,000 in equity and can now contemplate the purchase of a home around $1.2 million to $1.5 million in other ‘less hot’ locations where they can get much more home for their money,” he told The Epoch Times.Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director at Real Estate Research, told The Epoch Times that the luxury market has been outperforming all other price segments over the past year—in particular, the $1 million-plus tier.“However, in May 2025, we saw a shift—sales in this segment declined 0.6 percent year over year, marking the first drop in over a year,” she said.“This softening at the top of the market suggests that broader market dynamics are catching up with high-end buyers.”Evangelou suggested that the recent stock market volatility could be a possible factor, as it often influences liquidity and buying behavior in the luxury market.Lewis believes those “moving up” will not only help fuel the tax base, but also the local economy with new luxury homeowners shopping, frequenting restaurants, and hiring specialized services such as landscaping and property management.On the flip side, the trend is forcing many potential buyers to drive further out from towns like Bozeman to find listings under $400,000.“This housing shortage also makes it harder for businesses to recruit and keep staff and often forces employers to invent interim housing fixes like temporary lodging,” Lewis said.While luxury sales remain strong, he contends they’re splitting the market in half.“Sellers who are selling properties priced above $1 million are still enjoying relatively quick sales, while homes priced from $600,000–900,000 are sitting on the market for longer, “ he said.Other Luxury Market TrendsMore than 68 percent of those surveyed by Coldwell Banker reported that clients are either maintaining or growing their real estate exposure, with another 51 percent reporting an increase in all-cash transactions. The report indicates that clients are also more unlikely to compromise on lifestyle preferences, property conditions, or luxury features.“Affluent buyers still see real estate as a safe haven to grow and protect their wealth,” Altneu said in a statement. “But as the market balances and more inventory comes online, they can also be more choosy than in recent years.”Another trend the report found is that real estate remains a cornerstone of wealth strategy, especially during times of economic uncertainty. It maintains that affluent buyers view real estate as safe haven as well as a valuable tool for portfolio diversification.“Smart Luxury” is a third emerging trend with luxury homebuyers making more practical considerations such as value for price, tax strategy, estate planning, and long-term investment potential. According to the report, these tend to be taking the place of over-the-top amenities or “trophy” locations.The fourth trend is a wider divide between the ultra-wealthy versus the aspirational buyer. This translates to buyers with a net worth of $1 million to $5 million as opposed to buyers with a net worth of $30 million and above. The report finds those in the $1 million to $5 million range tend to be more cautious and often target homes with renovation potential.The final trend pertains to cash buyers, with 96 percent of Coldwell’s luxury specialists reporting buyers maintaining or increasing all-cash deals.“Ultra-high-net-worth individuals are not just buying one property—they’re building real estate portfolio,” Jade Mills, international ambassador of the Coldwell Banker Global Luxury Program said in the report.“These buyers are paying all cash specifically because they want hard assets independent of market swings.”The report quotes data from the Institute for Luxury Marketing showing the luxury single-family home inventory has escalated by 19.6 percent and attached property inventory by 14.8 percent compared with 2024. Still, single-family home prices grew by 1.8 percent year over year and 8 percent compared with 2023. Prices for attached properties have advanced even more—by 8.4 percent year over year and 16.5 percent over the past two years.An April study by the University of California San Diego Rady School of Management found that all cash home buyers have an advantage by paying about 10 percent less than mortgage buyers.“When sellers accept a mortgage offer, it comes with risk,” Michael Reher, study co-author and assistant professor of finance at the Rady School of Management said in a statement. “There is a risk the deal will fall through because there’s a third-party mortgage lender who needs to approve the loan for the borrower .”Reher and a colleague conducted the study after they both had experienced mortgage offers to homes being rejected because sellers chose an all-cash offer instead.A recent Bankrate blog on cash offers weighs both the pros and cons of these types of transactions, noting quicker closing and less red tape when dealing with a lender, but also the possibility of not receiving the highest amount on the deal.“Ultimately, deciding whether an all-cash offer is right for you will depend on whether you want to sell as fast as possible,” the webpage reported. “If you have time and want to aim for top dollar, you might get a better deal from a buyer who’s financing.” Tyler DurdenMon, 07/07/2025 - 11:40",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/luxury-housing-market-no-longer-out-reach-some-move-buyers-report,business,

These chemicals are tailored for specialized tasks such as wafer cleaning, etching, and surface treatment. Their formulation ensures minimal impurity levels, which is critical in nanometer-scale production environments. As chip designs become more complex and layered, the demand for high-purity functional wet chemicals rises. These chemicals enable better yield, consistent quality, and reduce the risk of wafer damage. With the shift towards advanced nodes (7nm, 5nm, and below), the role of these specialized solutions becomes even more critical. The increasing investment in new fabrication plants and R&D around EUV lithography further amplifies the need for high-performance functional wet chemicals.General wet chemicals such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen peroxide serve as the backbone of several foundational processes in semiconductor manufacturing, thereby significantly contributing to market growth. These chemicals are widely used for surface preparation, cleaning, and oxide stripping. Although basic in nature, their application demands high levels of purity and consistency to avoid contamination at micro and nano scales. As fabs increase their production capacity to meet growing demands for consumer electronics, automotive chips, and communication devices, the consumption of general wet chemicals is scaling rapidly. Their relatively lower cost combined with essential utility makes them a continuous requirement across both legacy and advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities globally.Industrial gases play an essential support role in the semiconductor sector, often working in conjunction with wet chemicals during etching and cleaning processes. Gases like nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen are integrated into wet chemical processing lines to maintain inert environments or drive specific reactions.

2025-07-07 15:30:11,Trump threatens not to chicken out yet again over tariffs,"On Sunday, President Donald Trump once again ratcheted up his destructive and nonsensical trade war, saying that the outrageously high ""Liberation Day"" tariff rates he announced in April will be put back in place for countries that do not reach trade deals before his arbitrary 90-day pause deadline expires on July 9.""I am pleased to announce that the UNITED STATES TARIFF Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World, will be delivered starting 12:00 P.M. (Eastern), Monday, July 7th. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMP, President of The United States of America,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Letters” is how the administration refers to notices of tariff rates “and/or deals.” This confirms a statement Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made on CNN earlier in the day when he said that if countries ""don’t move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.”Trump also took his tariff threat a step further, saying in a subsequent Truth Social post that, ""Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy."" The 11 nations in the BRICS alliance have threatened to make their own form of currency, which Trump is seeking to stop.Of course, who the heck knows what will happen with tariff rates, as Trump on Sunday appeared confused by reporters' questions about if and when the “Liberation Day” tariffs would go back into effect when the 90-day pause expires. “Do the tariff rates change at all on July 9th or do they change on August 1st?” a reporter asked Trump. “What are you talking about?” Trump replied.When the reporter pressed again about what day the tariffs would go back into place, Trump responded with more word salad that didn’t answer the question.“They're going to be tariffs. The tariffs are going to be the tariffs. I think we'll have most countries done by July 9th. Yeah. Either a letter or a deal,” Trump said.xxYouTube VideoUltimately, if Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs—which were not only ridiculously high but were so shoddily done that even countries like the uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands received tariffs—go back into effect, it will have horrible consequences for the U.S. economy.When he first announced the tariffs in April, it sent the stock market into a tailspin, as investors worried that Trump's trade policy would plunge the United States into a recession.But as it became clear that Trump almost always pulls a TACO (which stands for Trump Always Chickens Out), investors no longer responded with fear to Trump's tariff announcements, as they assume he will reverse them before they cause too much harm to the economy.Indeed, the stock market on Monday has barely reacted to Trump's latest tariff threats, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 barely down.Still, even at the current 10% tariff rate Trump has placed on nearly every country in the world, inflation has ticked up slightly and the private sector job market is weakening.If Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs do go into place, economists say the bottom will fall out.“‘We haven’t seen price hikes yet’ is not the win some folks think it is. Our data are backward looking, and many of the worst tariffs are in the midst of a soon-to-end 90 day pause. Economic gravity still applies: Tariffs raise costs, and someone's going to pay,” economist Justin Wolfers told CNN.Campaign Action",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/7/2332135/-Trump-threatens-not-to-chicken-out-yet-again-over-tariffs,politics,

LindellTV, the outlet helmed by Trump ally Mike Lindell, posted on X.""Assuming this leaked Epstein Files memo is true, then we all know this is a shameful coverup to protect the most heinous elites,"" added influencer Rogan O'Handley, who goes by DC Draino.Zoom out: Axios first reported Sunday that the Justice Department and FBI had written a memo saying they found no evidence Epstein had killed himself, kept a ""client list"" or extorted powerful figures.The administration also released video from the hours before Epstein's death showing that nobody else had entered his cell.The memo said nobody else involved in the Epstein case will be charged and that the administration would not release any material in its possession detailing child sexual abuse or information on Epstein's victims.Between the lines: Patel and Bongino were both prominent purveyors of conspiracy theories around Epstein's death as influencers prior to Trump's inauguration.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/jeffrey-epstein-trump-maga-patel-bongino,politics,

President Donald Trump’s tariffs, travel bans, inflammatory rhetoric and harsh immigration policies have combined for a chilling effect on visitors—and there’s little indication of a reversal anytime soon,"" Forbes reported.Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics, told Forbes, “Given we’re halfway through the year and we’ve seen these impacts, we don't know when the stiffest headwind is, but I think it does stay sustained. We’re generally assuming that this persists for a while and that some of it is going to persist throughout the end of the administration.”Read the Forbes article here.",rawstory,https://www.rawstory.com/putting-up-the-closed-sign-trump-policies-costing-us-tourism-29b/,politics,

2025-07-07 16:08:06,Hidden megabill clause hands taxpayers bill for huge gift to private jet owners,"The Republican budget measure that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law late last week contains a provision that analysts say will allow private jet owners to write off the full cost of their aircraft in the first year of purchase, a boon to the ultra-rich that comes as millions of people are set to lose healthcare under the same legislation.FlyUSA, a private aviation provider, gushed in a blog post that with final passage of the unpopular budget reconciliation package, ""business jet ownership has never looked more fiscally attractive or more fun to explain to your accountant.""The law, crafted by congressional Republicans and approved with only GOP support, permanently restores a major corporate tax break known as 100% bonus depreciation, which allows businesses to deduct the costs of certain assets in the first year of purchase rather than writing them off over time.Forbes noted that the bonus depreciation policy ""applies to a slew of qualified, physical business expenses which depreciate over time, such as machinery and company cars, but the policy is often associated with big-ticket luxury items, such as private aircraft, and its institution last decade led to a boom in jet sales.""Chuck Collins, director of the Program on Inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies, called bonus depreciation ""a massive tax break for billionaires and centi-millionaires that use the most polluting form of transportation on the planet.""""A corporation purchasing a $50 million private jet could potentially deduct the entire $50 million from their taxes in the year of the purchase, rather than spreading the deduction over many years,"" Collins wrote. ""This amounts to a massive taxpayer subsidy, as ordinary taxpayers pick up the tab for the private jet industry and billionaire high flyers.""""Subsidizing more private jets on a warming planet is reckless and indefensible,"" he added.The National Business Aviation Association, a lobbying group for the private aviation industry, celebrated passage of the Republican legislation, specifically welcoming the bonus depreciation policy as ""effective for incentivizing aircraft purchase."" (The Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy argues that ""depreciation tax breaks have never been shown to encourage more capital investment."")Meanwhile, communities across the United States are bracing for the law's deep cuts to Medicaid and federal nutrition assistance, which are expected to impose damaging strains on state budgets and strip food benefits and health coverage from millions of low-income Americans.""Trump and congressional Republicans have certainly delivered for the billionaire class,"" said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen. ""This is certainly one of the cruelest bills in American history, backtracking on the country's painfully slow history of expanding healthcare coverage and, equally remarkably, taking food away from the hungry.""""That's a lot of needless suffering just to make the richest Americans richer,"" he added.",rawstory,https://www.rawstory.com/hidden-clause-in-megabill-gives/,politics,

2025-07-07 15:58:10,Global trade is back in limbo,"Global trade rules are about as hazy now as in early April, when the White House touted ""90 deals in 90 days"" that would ease the uncertainty.Why it matters: Since the April 9 trade war de-escalation, businesses have been waiting for clarity on where tariffs will settle so they can adapt their supply chains and pricing accordingly.It now appears as if the July 9 deadline for those deals will pass with little certainty. For business leaders, the fear is that the trade wars started when Donald Trump took office don't have a firm end date, a worry that grows with each shifting deadline. What they're saying: ""Whatever deals there are going to be, let's just ink it and move on,"" says Sue Spence, the chair of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing business survey committee.""But even if that happens, there is such a disbelief it will stick,"" says Spence, who surveys manufacturers each month to gauge the industry's health.What's new: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC early Monday that trade announcements were coming in the next 48 hours.Bessent said ""we've had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations"" since Trump threatened that countries could revert back to the tariffs outlined on Liberation Day.""My mailbox was full last night with a lot of new offers, a lot of new proposals,"" he said.Yes, but: Bessent also pointed to August 1 as the next date to watch, when countries that have not landed deals will see tariff rates revert back to those announced in early April.Trump posted on Truth Social last night that ""UNITED STATES TARIFF letters and/or Deals with various Countries from around the World"" will be delivered starting at noon Monday.What to watch: Today sets off the latest murky timeline that business leaders will struggle to understand. The list of dates already includes July 21, when the U.S. and Canada are supposed to notch a deal. There is also Aug. 12, when the 90-day trade truce with China expires.The Trump administration has announced trade frameworks with the U.K. and Vietnam, though agreements with other major trading partners — Japan and Mexico, for instance — look uncertain. The European Commission's Ursula von der Leyen ""had a good exchange"" with Trump last night, the bloc said. It is a hint that talks might be moving in the right direction ahead of Wednesday, when tariffs on European goods are threatened to jump to 50%.Tariff threats aheadThe prospect of substantially higher import taxes remains, even if there are a wave of tariff deals announced in the days ahead.The Commerce Department is considering the potential for tariffs on individual sectors — including chips, pharmaceuticals and more — under its trade authorities, Section 232 and Section 301.Trump last night threatened to impose additional tariffs on the ""BRICS"" (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), ahead of their annual gathering in South America.The big picture: ""Historically, fully fledged trade deals take, on average, three years to conclude, not three months,"" Morgan Stanley economists wrote in a note this morning.""Our best guess is that any near-term announcements will not be comprehensive and permanent, and will likely be some kind of blanket agreement,"" they add.""Even if we get a range of agreements on July 8/9, because of all the uncertainty noted above, the next question will obviously be, for how long is this agreement valid?""The intrigue: Businesses are yearning for some clarity — a sense that whatever the new tariff regime may look like, it will remain relatively stable.Asked what certainty in this new era might look like, ISM's Spence says: ""Enough time needs to go by with no other changes.""""If I'm the CFO of a company, and there is a deal in place with China and Europe, and three months go by and there hasn't been a big change, relations seem good with no new threats — then maybe I am going to be comfortable enough to move forward with decisions I have delayed,"" Spence says.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/trump-tariffs-trade-war,politics,
2025-07-07 15:56:55,Revealed: White House emails show desperate rush to punish universities,"President Donald Trump told staffers that he wanted even more punitive measures against top universities, according to newly revealed communications.NOTUS reviewed a March 18 email chain titled ""Funding yanked from San Jose State + UPenn"" that included high-ranking White House officials. It surfaced in court documents as part of a case challenging Elon Musk's funding freezes, and the messages show how senior officials coordinated with DOGE teams and Fox News to carry out the president's wishes.“POTUS wants to see more action against universities,” wrote senior policy strategist May Mailman, and officials then scurried to make that happen.The emails show a previously unreported effort by the administration to target San Joe State before a Title XI investigation into transgender athletes had concluded, but officials were concerned about how the punitive funding cuts would look if they touched on national security or public health.“If you all deem we should turn this back on, we can do that immediately given criticality- it’s just a simple email given we didn’t terminate,” wrote federal acquisition service commissioner Josh Gruenbaum.However, those concerns were outweighed by the White House's desire to punish the schools – and quickly.“Today, we have paused ALL grant awards to San Jose State which continued to play a male athlete on the female volleyball team, including access to intimate, overnight spaces,” read the first draft that Mailman sent to the White House communications team.Trump had taken an interest in San Jose State during the 2024 campaign after an online publication outed volleyball player Blaire Fleming as trans, and Mailman – who works closely with White House deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller – pushed other officials to quickly identify sweeping cuts to that university and Penn, which the administration targeted for in the past allowing a trans athlete to compete on the women’s swimming team.“Josh,” Mailman wrote back, “per Stephen, we need to get this on social media TODAY. Please no more piecemeal emails. Just one with clear bullet points on what’s being frozen/paused and from which agency. THANK YOU!!!”The following morning Fox Business flashed a breaking news alert and reported on the threatened cuts to the university using language that mirrored the communications team's draft statement.“President Trump has promised to protect female athletes, he has threatened to rip federal funding away from any university that defies his executive order banning biological males from infiltrating women’s sports, and he is doing it,” said Fox Business host Hillary Vaughn, reading from her phone live on air. “We are the first to report President Trump has paused $175 million in federal funding from the University of Pennsylvania over its controversial policies.”",rawstory,https://www.rawstory.com/revealed-2672853689/,politics,

Shares of companies like Ubtech Robotics (9880.HK), Dobot (2432.HK) and Horizon Robotics (9660.HK), have been feeding off the frenzy, rising 50% or more in the past year. One standout in the group is Hong Kong Robotics Group Holding Ltd. (0370.HK), a Johnny-come-lately whose stock that has soared more than sixfold this year. Despite the gains, the company recently released disappointing annual results that showed its revenue fell 45.6% to a meager HK$116 million ($14.78 million) for its fiscal year through March, as its loss widened 5.3% to HK$138 million. It also reported a HK$11.32 million impairment loss on loans and interest receivable, with additional impairment losses on goodwill and property totaling HK$21.82 million and HK$39.37 million, respectively. Those are hardly what you'd expect from such a stellar stock performer. Robotics joint venture Such a dismal performance begs the question of why the stock has surged so much. The story dates back to an agreement signed around Valentine's Day when the company, then called China Best Group, agreed to form a joint venture with China's Dataa Robotics to explore and develop humanoid robots for civilian uses. China Best Group, which took on its current name in May, was tasked with securing the venture's financing, while Dataa Robotics provided the technology. Other unknown Hong Kong companies have made similar pivots to take advantage of hot sectors over the years, often through M&A, banking on resulting surges in their stock prices to quickly raise funds.

2025-07-08 13:05:00,Netanyahu Presents Trump With Nomination For Nobel Peace Prize As Both Downplay 'Two-State Solution',"Netanyahu Presents Trump With Nomination For Nobel Peace Prize As Both Downplay 'Two-State Solution' Among the more interesting highlights from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House on Monday was that during the Trump-hosted dinner, and at a moment the Gaza war is still raging, Bibi presented the US president with a letter nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize.Part of the stated rationale was that Trump pushed for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which has held, though the whole 12-day war seemed highly planned and choreographed between Washington and Tel Aviv. Widespread reports said that Trump greenlit Israel's surprise attack and even set up a sham nuclear talks process in order to lull Iran into a false sense of comfort. The Abraham Accords were also a big reason for Netanyahu's gesture.""The president has already realized a great opportunity. He forged the Abraham Accords. He’s forging peace as we speak in one country and one region after the other,"" Netanyahu said. ""So, I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize committee. It’s nominating you for the peace prize, which is well deserved.""Via Fox News""This I didn’t know,"" Trump said upon receiving and looking over the letter. ""Wow. Thank you very much. Coming from you in particular, this is very meaningful.""But ironically, at this very moment the region is still on fire - literally and figuratively. War is flaring up again the Red Sea and in Yemen, Israel's military is still taking on mass casualties and inflicting them on the Palestinian population in Gaza, and Syria is now overrun by various terrorist groups in the wake of Assad's fall. Israel's military is also still taking occasional shots at Lebanon, including bombing raids.As its stands, President Trump doesn't seem in the mood to employ the standard two-state solution talking point of pretty much all past and recent administrations. He responded, ""I don't know"" when he was asked by reporters whether a two-state solution was possible.Netanyahu, for his part, explained that ""After October 7th, people said the Palestinians have a state, a Hamas state in Gaza and look what they did with it. They didn't build it up. They built down into bunkers, into terror tunnels after which they massacred our people, raped our women, beheaded our men, invaded our cities and our towns, our kibbutzim and did horrendous massacres, the kind of which we didn't see since World War II and the Nazis, the Holocaust. So people aren't likely to say, 'Let's just give them another state.' It'll be a platform to destroy Israel.""Netanyahu seems to be saying it's 'either us or them' in terms of who is fated for destruction. His brutal policies in Gaza also speak loudest.""We will work out a peace with our Palestinian neighbors, those who don't want to destroy us and we will work out a peace in which our security, the sovereign power of security, always remains in our hands,"" Netanyahu continued.""Now people will say, 'It's not a complete state, it's not a state, it's not that.' We don't care. We vowed never again. Never again is now. It's not going to happen again.""Another interesting moment from the White House dinner, related to Syria and regional geopolitics:Trump finally publicly admitted that Netanyahu asked him to lift sanctions on Syria, in case anyone is still denying Jolani's utility for Israel.Trump was very impressed by Jolani and said his tough background (ISIS/AQ) makes sense, since ""he's from a tough part of the world."" pic.twitter.com/cX3URpNQUp— Lindsey Snell (@LindseySnell) July 8, 2025Trump has appeared generally supportive of this more hawkish and unbending stance from the Israeli leader, even as diplomats in the region continue to forge ahead on renewed ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel, which are being conducted 'indirectly'.

2025-07-08 13:04:09,Elon Musk lashes out at Tesla bull Dan Ives over board proposals: ‘Shut up',"The S&P 500 was trading little changed after President Donald Trump on Tuesday offered no exceptions to his Aug. 1 tariff start date.The broad market benchmark was little changed, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 126 points, or 0.3%.Traders had trouble keeping up with the conflicting signals from Trump on trade. Trump on Monday pushed the tariff deadline to Aug. 1 from July 9. Then, late Monday he said that new deadline was “not 100% firm.”However, on Tuesday, the president posted on Truth Social that there would be no change or extensions granted to the Aug. 1 date.Tuesday’s listless action follows Monday’s deep sell-off with the Dow tumbling more than 400 points as Trump slapped 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan. Trump hit at least 14 countries in total with new duties on Monday.Investors are waiting for more clarity with many expecting the ultimate tariff rates set to not be as strict as Trump is threatening.“What we’ve seen since April has really been the markets getting past the idea that tariffs would have a particularly detrimental impact on growth, earnings, inflation, etc.,” said Bill Merz, head of capital markets research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “Investor sentiment has shifted a lot in a very short period of time and become more optimistic, as we can see in equity market pricing and how we’re right around all time highs across multiple indices.”On the upside, Nvidia nudged higher, closing in on a $4 trillion market cap. But banks helped weigh down the market, after HSBC adopted a “more cautious stance” on larger banks. Shares of JPMorgan and Bank of America shed 3%, while Goldman Sachs slipped 2%.Latest round of tariffs are not a ‘done deal,’ says Bank of AmericaPresident Donald Trump’s most recent slate of tariffs are still a work in progress with more work to be done, according to Bank of America.“We don’t think the tariffs announced yesterday are a done deal. Rather, the extension of the deadline from July 9 to August 1 suggests there is still room for negotiation,” BofA economist Antonio Gabriel wrote on Tuesday. “But if the tariffs are implemented, we estimate they should add about 0.1pp to inflation and subtract a similar amount from growth.”— Brian EvansInvestor Keith Lerner reiterates bullish stance on equity marketGoing forward, investor Keith Lerner believes that the market “deserves the benefit of the doubt.”“This bull market has earned the benefit of the doubt, and even if it’s a slower trajectory higher and with some hiccups along the way, I still think the trend is one that moves up over the duration of the year,” the Truist Wealth co-chief investment officer said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” Tuesday morning.Lerner pointed to strong corporate earnings as a driving force behind the market’s current resilience.— Lisa Kailai HanCopper prices hit record after Trump announces 50% tariff Copper futures hit a record high after Trump abruptly announced 50% tariffs on all imports of the metal during a White House Cabinet meeting.The copper futures contract for September jumped 10.5% to $5.8955 per pound. Shares of copper miner Freeport-McMoRan jumped more than 5% in response the president’s announcement.— Spencer KimballElon Musk doesn’t like Dan Ives’ plan to fix Tesla Elon Musk told Wedbush analyst Dan Ives to “shut up” after he laid out a plan to reign in the Tesla CEO. Ives said Tesla’s board of directors should approve a pay package that would give Musk 25% voting control of the electric vehicle maker. But the package would come with strings attached. The board would have oversight over Musk’s political activities and the CEO would be required to spend a certain amount of time at Tesla, Ives said in a post on X.

In other words, all money will be due and payable starting AUGUST 1, 2025 – No extensions will be granted,” the post said.— Jesse PoundTariffs raise near term risk to recent equities strength, says Wolfe ResearchPresident Donald Trump’s latest moves on tariffs could be a catalyst for stocks to lose steam in the near-term, according to Wolfe Research.“Investors seem to be dismissing the upside risk to inflation. But someone ultimately has to pay the tariffs—likely showing up in CPI, profit margins, or (realistically) a combination of both,” Wolfe Research chief economist Stephanie Roth wrote in a Tuesday note. “While we still expect the economy to hold up, this raises near-term risks to the equity rally so far and reinforces our base case that the Fed stays on hold this year given the looming inflationary impact,” she added.— Brian EvansOppenheimer remains bullish on U.S. stocks, prefers cyclical namesOppenheimer Asset Management remains bullish on U.S. equities at this time, the firm’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus wrote in a Monday note.Specifically, the firm prefers cyclical stocks over their more defensive counterparts. These cyclical sectors include information technology, consumer discretionary, communication services, industrials and financials.“We anticipate continued positive corporate earnings growth, a key driver of equity valuations,” Stoltzfus wrote. “Our intermediate- and longer-term outlook for the U.S. economy and the stock market remains decidedly bullish. We believe U.S. economic fundamentals remain on solid footing. As the drag of tight monetary policy eases, job growth and consumption and business fixed investment demand should continue to exhibit resilience. In addition, should the economy appear to falter, the Federal Reserve has the ability to move swiftly to cut rates further to provide economic stimulus and reinvigorate demand.”— Lisa Kailai HanStocks open little changed on TuesdayStocks were little changed to kick off Tuesday’s trading session.The S&P 500 was marginally higher.

If so, its unlikely to be enough to dampen investors enthusiasm for US equities,” Matthews said in a note to clients.However, the same may not be true for Federal Reserve officials. “It’s been clear in recent weeks that many FOMC members are not confident cutting rates until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer, and we doubt they’ll cut this year. That would be bad news for Treasuries given current pricing. But it might, eventually, give the dollar a boost, even if whatever is behind its apparent risk premium takes longer to fade,” Matthews said. — Jesse PoundAmazon stock rises as Prime Day kicks offThomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesShares of Amazon rose slightly in Tuesday’s premarket session as the e-commerce seller’s annual four-day Prime Day sales event commenced.The stock was last trading nearly 0.4% higher.Amazon’s Prime Day promotion runs from July 8 to July 11 this year.

That compares to a $16 billion increase in the year-ago period and a $15.3 billion gain in the first quarter of 2025.“Dividend growth has continued, but is noticeably slower than had been hoped for, though it is in line with expectations given the economic certainties,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in an e-mail.He added that while this uncertainty doesn’t seem to have stopped increases, it seems to have capped the size of these hikes.Silverblatt noted that dividend increases may be limited as companies take a wait-and-see approach toward global government policy that’s constantly changing and worries over employment and inflation.He also said that the third quarter is expected to start with an improvement from major banks, which have lifted their dividends in light of the Federal Reserve’s stress test results.— Darla MercadoTrump announces steep tariffs on 14 countriesCelal Gunes | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUnited States President Donald Trump walks toward the White House upon his arrival from New Jersey in Washington DC on July 6, 2025. U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on 14 countries to go into effect Aug. 1 that were more severe than investors were expecting. Those countries hit by new tariffs are Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia.The countries were hit with import duties that are similar to, and in some cases even higher than, what Trump first announced back in April in his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs. Japan, for example, was hit with a 25% levy that’s a little bit above the 24% rate Trump initially said in April. Malaysia was hit with a 25% tariff rate, also higher than the previous 24% level.— Sarah Min, Kevin BreuningerStock futures open lower Stock futures opened lower Monday night.

The age range expansion comes as Waymo seeks to increase ridership amid a broader expansion of its ride-hailing service across U.S. cities. Waymo said it will offer “specially-trained Rider Support agents” during rides hailed by teens and loop in parents if needed. Teens can also share their trip status with their parents for real-time updates.Waymo announced Tuesday that it is offering accounts for teens ages 14 to 17, starting in Phoenix.The Alphabet-owned company said that, beginning Tuesday, parents in Phoenix can use their Waymo accounts “to invite their teen into the program, pairing them together.” Once their account is activated, teens can hail fully autonomous rides.Previously, users were required to be at least 18 years old to sign up for a Waymo account, but the age range expansion comes as the company seeks to increase ridership amid a broader expansion of its ride-hailing service across U.S. cities. Alphabet has also been under pressure to monetize AI products amid increased competition and economic headwinds.Waymo said it will offer “specially-trained Rider Support agents” during rides hailed by teens and loop in parents if needed. Teens can also share their trip status with their parents for real-time updates on their progress, and parents receive all ride receipts.Teen accounts are initially only being offered to riders in the metro Phoenix area. Teen accounts will expand to more markets outside California where the Waymo app is available in the future, a spokesperson said.Waymo’s expansion to teens follows a similar move by Uber, which launched teen accounts in 2023. Waymo, which has partnerships with Uber in multiple markets, said it “may consider enabling access for teens through our network partners in the future.”Already, Waymo provides more than 250,000 paid trips each week across Phoenix, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Austin, Texas, and the company is preparing to bring autonomous rides to Miami and Washington, D.C., in 2026.In June, Waymo announced that it plans to manually drive vehicles in New York, marking the first step toward potentially cracking the largest U.S. city. Waymo said it applied for a permit with the New York City Department of Transportation to operate autonomously with a trained specialist behind the wheel in Manhattan.WATCH: We went to Texas for Tesla’s robotaxi launch.

2025-07-08 13:00:14,"American kids have become increasingly unhealthy over nearly two decades, new study finds","The health of U.S. children has deteriorated over the past 17 years, with kids today more likely to have obesity, chronic diseases and mental health problems like depression, a new study says.Much of what researchers found was already known, but the study paints a comprehensive picture by examining various aspects of children’s physical and mental health at the same time.“The surprising part of the study wasn’t any with any single statistic; it was that there’s 170 indicators, eight data sources, all showing the same thing: a generalized decline in kids’ health,” said Dr. Christopher Forrest, one of the authors of the study published Monday in Journal of the American Medical Association.Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has brought children's health to the forefront of the national policy conversation, unveiling in May a much-anticipated “Make America Healthy Again” report that described kids as undernourished and overmedicated, and raised concerns about their lack of physical activity. But the Trump administration's actions — including cuts to federal health agencies, Medicaid and scientific research — are not likely to reverse the trend, according to outside experts who reviewed Monday’s study.“The health of kids in America is not as good as it should be, not as good as the other countries, and the current policies of this administration are definitely going to make it worse,” said Dr. Frederick Rivara, a pediatrician and researcher at the Seattle Children's Hospital and UW Medicine in Seattle. He co-authored an editorial accompanying the new study.Forrest and his colleagues analyzed surveys, electronic health records from 10 pediatric health systems and international mortality statistics. Among their findings:Obesity rates for U.S. children 2-19 years old rose from 17% in 2007-2008 to about 21% in 2021-2023.A U.S. child in 2023 was 15% to 20% more likely than a U.S. child in 2011 to have a chronic condition such as anxiety, depression or sleep apnea, according to data reported by parents and doctors.Annual prevalence rates for 97 chronic conditions recorded by doctors rose from about 40% in 2011 to about 46% in 2023.Early onset of menstruation, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, physical symptoms, depressive symptoms and loneliness also increased among American kids during the study period.American children were around 1.8 times more likely to die than kids in other high-income countries from 2007-2022. Being born premature and sudden unexpected death were much higher among U.S. infants, and firearm-related incidents and motor vehicle crashes were much more common among 1-19-year-old American kids than among those the same age in other countries examined.The research points to bigger problems with America’s health, said Forrest, who is a pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.“Kids are the canaries in the coal mine,” he said. “ When kids’ health changes, it’s because they’re at increased vulnerability, and it reflects what’s happening in society at large.”The timing of the study, he said, is “completely fortuitous."" Well before the 2024 presidential election, Forrest was working on a book about thriving over the life span and couldn’t find this sort of comprehensive data on children’s health.Related | RFK Jr. doesn't care if poor kids lose their teethThe datasets analyzed have some limitations and may not be applicable to the full U.S. population, noted Dr. James Perrin, a pediatrician and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, who wasn't involved in the study.“The basic finding is true,” he saidThe editorial published alongside the study said while the administration's MAHA movement is bringing welcome attention to chronic diseases, ""it is pursuing other policies that will work against the interests of children.” Those include eliminating injury prevention and maternal health programs, canceling investments in a campaign addressing sudden infant death and “fueling vaccine hesitancy among parents that may lead to a resurgence of deadly vaccine-preventable diseases,"" authors wrote.Related | RFK Jr. keeps finding new ways to push dangerous anti-vax crusadeOfficials from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department did not respond to a request for comment.Forrest said risks highlighted by the MAHA report, such as eating too much ultra-processed food, are real but miss the complex reality driving trends in children's health.“We have to step back and take some lessons from the ecological sustainability community and say: Let’s look at the ecosystem that kids are growing up in. And let’s start on a kind of neighborhood-by-neighborhood, city-by-city basis, examining it,” he said.Campaign Action",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/8/2332177/-American-kids-have-become-increasingly-unhealthy-over-nearly-two-decades-new-study-finds,politics,

2025-07-08 12:39:24,Trump outrage is hiding the real danger to America,"Americans are waking up to President Donald Trump’s assaults on our democracy. In just four years, his documented lies have topped 30,000. He has also broken laws, including his attempts to dismantle government agencies, his blatant conflicts of interest with Elon Musk, and his disregarding courts on a number of fronts. We honor those courageously stepping up to hold Trump accountable—from Indivisible to Common Cause to Democracy Forward, and many more citizen-organizing efforts.But our appropriate outrage might hide a danger—that in focusing on Trump’s shocking amorality we could slide over a painful truth we must embrace to create the democracy we need and want: His rise is a symptom. Donald Trump was able to triumph because of deep dysfunction long built into our governing structures. While we must resist his actions and work to limit the immediate damage, we must also commit to fighting for an even more democratic future, free of our current limitations.Simply put, some features of our democracy are baked-in barriers to one-person-one-vote. The Senate, to name one. Wyoming, with a population of just over half a million has the same number of Senate seats as California, home to nearly 40 million. In other words, a voter in Wyoming has almost 68 times greater representation than a voter in much more densely populated California.Our fight can’t merely be against Trump but in pursuit of a positive vision of an America where each of us counts, and we work together building the world we want.And the challenges don’t stop there. Gerrymandering of electoral districts—the redrawing of district lines to favor the party in power—creates unrepresentative legislatures. As a result, one report found Republicans had an advantage of about 16 House seats in 2024’s congressional election. And then, there’s voter suppression as well as the hugely corrupting role of money in politics and the limits of our two-party system.Despite being unfit, Trump rose to power in large measure because our antidemocratic rules have led to deep dissatisfaction with government that he was able to tap. Indeed, it’s been nearly four decades since 60% of us expressed satisfaction with “the way democracy was working.”Since then, approval has tumbled steeply. By early 2023, just 28% of U.S. adults expressed satisfaction with how our democracy is working. And by early 2025 well more than half of Americans—61 percent—remained dissatisfied. And Americans’ view of our standing in the world?Despite deep doubts about our democracy, interestingly, over half of us still see our country as one of the world’s greatest. One in five even place the us at the top, and only 27% acknowledge there are better democracies.Hmm. Self-perception can be self-deception: In global comparisons we rate shockingly low. Each year, Freedom House, founded by Eleanor Roosevelt, ranks nations by the quality of their political rights and civil liberties—a reasonable measure of democracy.Sadly, the U.S. ranks 57th worldwide, and not even in the ballpark of nations we imagine to be our peers. Almost all European Union nations rank in the top 25.Really? That bad?Yes. So, how do we explain the disconnect? And how might we use this bad news for good?Domestically, we know that there are deep roots to dissatisfaction with our democracy. But it’s not just the structural features named above: At the same time, our extreme economic inequality—deeper than more than 100 nations—means economic stress for most Americans, even as we hold onto the myth that we’re a middle-class country.Still, the myth of American exceptionalism blinds us.Instead, let us heed this truth: Be it a rocky marriage or a sprained ankle, healing starts when we get honest with ourselves—when we stop averting our eyes, making excuses, or just hoping one day it will all go away.Today, as our democracy is diminishing before our eyes; let’s drop these dangerous escapes and choose constructive action. The good news in our sad scores is proof of possibility—hard evidence that we can do better as we learn lessons from the leading democracies.So, let our dissatisfaction fuel determination and bold action. Our fight can’t merely be against Trump but in pursuit of a positive vision of an America where each of us counts, and we work together building the world we want.Democracy is not a dull duty but a thrilling vision and empowering action.",rawstory,https://www.rawstory.com/trump-fury/,politics,

2025-07-09 11:01:21,In a World of Bulls and Bears. Be the Tiger,"Foundedin 2014, Tickmill has been one of the mostcompetitive, visible, and stable brokers in the industry. CMO Kay Hook talks tous about the concept behind the international multi-asset broker’s latest brandupdate and bold statement, “In a World of Bulls and Bears - Be the Tiger.” Tickmill’s new updated brand identity and bold new positioning are, let’s behonest, rare for a veteran broker. What does that mean for the company and itstraders?Kay:You’re completely right, and we are very proud of our different approach. Theindustry typically follows more well-travelled paths and uses proven formulas,especially when it comes to branding. But our brand update is more than itsvisuals, even though that is extremely important as well; it is a roadmap ofhow we think, operate, and deliver value. Markets, news, reports, and badconditions, the world traders live in is often precarious, unpredictable, andloud. In contrast to that, we wanted our brand to represent stability, clarity,and trust. We wanted to be innovative and disrupt. We want to offer the bestpossible value proposition to our traders. Included in this new identity is your positioningstatement, “Advantage, built for traders.” Could you please elaborate on whatthat means for your traders?Kay: It states our commitment to our traders, so in that sense,maybe it can be considered both a positioning statement and a motto. “UnfairAdvantage” means providing our traders with everything that sets them up tosucceed. They get tools and conditions necessary to gain an edge. The goal isto empower our clients to enter markets with confidence, trade with precision,and ultimately achieve the goals they set at the beginning of their tradingsession. And we aren’t overpromising; everything we develop is builtby traders, for traders and has been based on the feedback we’ve received fromour community from the beginning. The second tagline is“In a World of Bulls and Bears - Be theTiger.” The metaphor of the trader as a tiger is a unique one, I’ve never heardit before. Do you mind elaborating on the idea behind it? Kay: The metaphor of Bull and Bear, at least according to theconsensus, comes from the way they attack. Bulls swipe upwards, and Bears swipedown. The tiger, though, is hyper-focused, strategically stalking, movingthrough heavy jungle growth, and perfectly timing its attacks. It uses speedand precision to achieve its goal.In that context, I hope the parallels are evident. When weask our traders to be tigers, we want them to use the speed and precision ourtechnology offers them. We want them to strategically follow the market and actusing the market-leading tools they have at their disposal, to act only whenpresented with an opportunity. Finally, through the refinement and claritywe’ve built into everything we do, we aim to help our traders cut through thenoise and move effortlessly towards their target. You have made some bold moves as Tickmill’s CMO. How have you approached this latest change?Kay:I’ve always had a performance-first philosophy. To achieve the results we wereshooting for, we combine creative storytelling and data. Those two marketingfunctions aren’t mutually exclusive, even though there is a slightmisconception that they are. Data without storytelling ignores an importantpart of marketing - speaking to our traders. Creative storytelling without datamakes it challenging to measure the performance of campaigns. I’malso deeply passionate about branding. As you’ve probably seen in our recentrefresh, I believe a brand isn’t just about how things look, it should alsowork strategically and support our bigger goals. A strong brand presence shouldbe memorable, distinct from the competition, and reinforce a company’s coreconcepts, which in our case is trust and stability.It’snot always easy, but it’s a key part of the job. Great storytelling is aboutfinding the right balance between design, language, and tone. And when backedby data, it can be refined and improved. When everything works together, thebrand becomes truly distinctive, which matters more than ever as the industrygrows more crowded. Inthis crowded landscape, shouting louder than everyone else just adds to thenoise—and honestly, it never really worked. What does work is offering realvalue: cutting through the clutter with clarity, consistency, and a trustedexperience that stands the test of time.I’mincredibly proud of the global marketing team who brought this brand evolutionand creative concept to life. Their dedication, creativity, and belief in whatwe’re building together made all the difference.

2025-07-09 11:00:47,"Most Fed officials see rate cuts coming, but opinions vary widely on how many, minutes show","Federal Reserve officials diverged at their June meeting about how aggressively they would be willing to cut interest rates, split between concerns over tariff-fueled inflation and signs of labor market weakness and economic strength.Minutes from the 17-18 meeting released Wednesday showed that policymakers largely held to a wait-and-see position on future rate moves. The meeting ended with Federal Open Market Committee members voting unanimously to hold the central bank’s key borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December 2024.However, the summary also showed a growing divide over how policy should proceed from here.“Most participants assessed that some reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate this year would likely be appropriate,” the minutes stated, as officials saw tariff-induced inflation pressures as potentially “temporary and modest” while economic growth and hiring could weaken.How far the cuts could go, though, was a matter of debate.Opinions ranged from a “couple” officials who said the next cut could come as soon as this month to “some” who thought no cuts this year would be appropriate. Though the minutes do not mention names, Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller have gone on record saying they could see their way to cutting rates as soon as the July 29-30 meeting if inflation stays under control.At the same time, “several” officials said they thought the current overnight funds rate “may not be far” from a neutral level, meaning only a few cuts may be ahead. Those officials cited inflation still above the 2% goal amid a “resilient” economy.In Fed parlance, some is more than several.Officials at the meeting updated their projections for rate cuts, expecting two this year followed by three more over the next couple years.The release comes with President Donald Trump ramping up pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his cohorts to cut aggressively. In public statements and on his Truth Social site, Trump has lambasted Powell, going as far to call for his resignation.Powell has said repeatedly that he won’t bow to political pressure when it comes to setting monetary policy. For the most part, he has joined the cautious approach, insisting that with a strong economy and uncertainty over inflation, the Fed is in a good position to stay on hold until it has more information.The minutes largely reflect that position that policy is currently well-positioned to respond to changes in the data.“Participants agreed that although uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook had decreased, it remained appropriate to take a careful approach in adjusting monetary policy,” the document stated.Officials also noted that they “might face difficult tradeoffs if elevated inflation proved to be more persistent while the outlook for employment weakened.” In that case, they said they would weigh which side was further from its goal in formulating policy.Since the meeting, Trump has continued negotiations with key U.S. trading partners, with the tariff ground shifting on a near-daily basis. Trump initially announced tariffs on April 2, and then has altered deadlines for agreements, most recently ticking off a series of letters to foreign leaders notifying them of looming levies should they not act.Recent data indicate that Trump’s tariffs have not Fed into prices, at least on a large scale.The consumer price index showed an increase of just 0.1% in May. While inflation gauges are still mostly above the Fed’s 2% target, recent sentiment surveys show the public is growing less fearful of inflation further down the road.“Many participants noted that the eventual effect of tariffs on inflation could be more limited if trade deals are reached soon, if firms are able to quickly adjust their supply chains, or if firms can use other margins of adjustment to reduce their exposure to the effects of tariffs,” the minutes stated.At the same time, job gains have slowed considerably, though the rate of nonfarm payrolls growth has consistent surprised economists.

She was primarily tasked with overseeing “business operations” at X, which included trying to placate advertisers as the social platform underwent substantial changes to its safety and content moderation policies.After Musk hurled insults, including “Go f— yourself,” at advertisers during the 2023 DealBook Summit, for instance, Yaccarino described Musk’s comments as an “explicit point of view about our position.”“We’re a platform that allows people to make their own decisions,” Yaccarino wrote in a post on X at the time. “And here’s my perspective when it comes to advertising: X is standing at a unique and amazing intersection of Free Speech and Main Street — and the X community is powerful and is here to welcome you. To our partners who believe in our meaningful work — Thank You.”Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.",nbcphiladelphia,https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/linda-yaccarino-steps-down-as-ceo-of-elon-musks-x/4229758/,business,

2025-07-09 10:32:02,Eli Manning says he's no longer interested in buying a piece of the NFL's Giants: ‘It's too expensive for me',"The S&P 500 rose Wednesday, led by tech, as Nvidia reached a major milestone and investors monitored the latest tariff updates from President Donald Trump.The broad market benchmark climbed 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 121 points, or 0.3%.Nvidia shares traded 2% higher, making it the first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion. Other major tech names also rose — including Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet — nodding to a rekindling in appetite for the AI theme.Those moves came as traders seemingly downplayed the latest tariff-related headlines of the week.On Wednesday, Trump sent letters dictating new U.S. tariff rates on goods from at least six more countries, including the Philippines and Iraq. This comes after Trump posted letters setting new duties earlier this week to the leaders of 14 other countries, including South Korea and Japan.On Tuesday, the president said in a Truth Social post that there would be no change or extensions on the raft of duties he announced this week. The new tariff rates range from 20% to 40% and are set to begin on Aug. 1.Trump on Tuesday also announced a 50% levy on copper imports and hinted that further sector-specific tariffs will soon be announced. He threatened Tuesday afternoon to impose up to 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., but said that he will “give people about a year, year and a half” until the duties go into effect.“The market is just shrugging these tariff threats off and presuming that there is room for deals and negotiations to be made,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird, in an interview with CNBC. “I think that the extension of the deadlines to Aug. 1 — and the occasional comment that those deadlines could even be kicked out farther — is an admission that there’s a deal making appetite, and the market is clearly going to run with that until proven otherwise.”Mayfield continued: “Because if the counter were true, I don’t think we would be anywhere near all-time highs.”Traders on Wednesday also awaited the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting.12 stocks in the S&P 500 hit new 52-week highsDuring Wednesday’s trading session, 12 stocks in the S&P 500 traded at new 52-week highs.Of these stocks, nine names were trading at new all-time highs.

The new targets implies about 14% upside from Tuesday’s close.Analyst Elizabeth Anderson believes the medical website for doctors “prudently” set its fiscal 2026 guidance in a conservative spot.She sees the medical website’s point-of-care and formulary business growing by at least mid-double digits in 2026 to $140 million. That would allow Doximity’s pharma business to grow 2% and still hit the midpoint of the company’s revenue guidance, which is $619 million to $631 million, she said.“Our current FY26 revenue estimate of $630 MM is on the high end of the mgmt’s current guidance range and could have 5%+ upside with continued market stability,” Anderson said in a note Wednesday.Doximity also has very high incremental margins in earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization when revenue outperforms, she noted. That could create $25 million in upside to EBITDA in 2026, she added.— Michelle FoxStocks making the biggest midday moves: AES, Nvidia and moreThese are the stocks moving the most in midday trading:AES — The stock jumped 17% following a Bloomberg report that the energy company was exploring a potential sale amid interest from infrastructure investors.Nvidia — The chip giant jumped 2% to touch a fresh all-time high and lift its market capitalization to $4 trillion, making it the first company to hit that threshold.Bloom Energy — The energy stock jumped more than 6% after a JPMorgan upgrade to overweight from neutral.

This is recency bias at its best, we are not in the COVID backdrop any longer and tariffs as an inflation risk akin to the 2022 experience is exaggerated.”Piper Sandler added that tariffs are a narrow tax that are likely to lead to pockets of price hikes, supply substitution and demand destruction rather than broad-based inflation.“An improvement in affordability solely from price declines is a worse outcome for the economy compared to one that includes lower rates,” the firm added. “A modest decline in short and long-term rates could go a long way to improving the breadth of economic activity and corporate earnings — something that’s been lacking in recent years.”— Lisa Kailai HanDOJ questions former UnitedHealth employees over Medicare billing practices, WSJ saysMike Blake | ReutersThe logo of UnitedHealth appears on the side of one of its office buildings in Santa Ana, California, on April 13, 2020.Investigators in the Department of Justice’s criminal health care fraud unit have interviewed former UnitedHealth employees about the company’s Medicare billing practices, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The report said the former employees were questioned in recent weeks about UnitedHealth’s efforts to record certain diagnoses that boosted payments and how the company encouraged the documentation of “lucrative” diagnoses through means such as testing patients and sending nurses to patients’ homes.Shares of UnitedHealth were nearly 3% lower in morning trading.— Sean ConlonNasdaq Composite hits all-time high Wednesday, bringing gain since ChatGPT debut to about 90% The Nasdaq Composite Index, founded in early 1971, hit another all-time intraday high in early trading Wednesday, touching 20,645.41, eclipsing the prior high of 20,624.51 from July 3 and leaving it some 6.1% higher on the year.The Composite is also on track to close at a new record high, beating the old closing high of 20,601.10, also from July 3.The Nasdaq has rallied about 90% since the introduction of the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT in late November 2022.— Scott SchnipperU.S. copper price premium over global benchmark soarsScott Olson | Getty ImagesCopper rods used to machine parts are stacked on a shelf at Makerite Manufacturing in Roscoe, Illinois.The premium paid for U.S. copper over prices elsewhere is at a record high, after Trump said Tuesday that a 50% tariff rate would be imposed on imports of the metal in the coming weeks.The gap in U.S. Comex futures over those on the London Metal Exchange, the global benchmark, spiked 138% on Tuesday following the announcement to more than $2,600 a tonne, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.8%.Nvidia shares traded 2% higher, making it the first company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion.

2025-07-09 09:56:55,Trump's ‘big beautiful bill' slashes CFPB funding: What it means for you,"The next Fed chair faces an additional burden: credibility issues now that President Donald Trump has stepped up efforts to exert a heavy hand on monetary policy. Trump reportedly is considering naming a “shadow chair” until the current occupant, Jerome Powell, leaves office next year, in an attempt to pressure the Fed into cutting rates. “The real loser here is not Jay Powell but his successor,” TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins wrote. “We don’t even know who that person is, and already there are strong doubts about their integrity and what sort of ‘deal’ they have made to secure the position.”If leading the Federal Reserve isn’t challenging enough, the next central bank chair faces an additional burden: credibility issues now that President Donald Trump has stepped up efforts to exert a heavy hand on monetary policy.Whoever the successful candidate is could carry the specter of being there simply to do Trump’s bidding on interest rates, violating the Fed’s traditionally apolitical veneer.To exert more influence in the near term, Trump reportedly is considering naming a “shadow chair” until the current occupant, Jerome Powell, leaves office next year, in an attempt to pressure the Fed into cutting rates.The prospect leaves a series of thorny questions.Beyond the awkward logistics of such an arrangement, there are potentially troublesome implications both institutionally for the Fed and for financial markets that count on it to make data-driven decisions free of outside influence.“Naturally, this is an idea that leaves many investors feeling uneasy,” Dario Perkins, senior European economist at TS Lombard, said in a note Tuesday titled “Can We Trust the Next Fed Chair?” “Suddenly all the talk is of the Fed ‘losing independence’ and of there being a new era of ‘fiscal dominance’ – not helped by the fact that Trump is explicitly linking his demand for lower rates to reducing debt-servicing costs.”Indeed, Fed officials generally make decisions in service to their twin goals, or “dual mandate,” namely to promote stable inflation or full employment.What Trump has been demanding is different — he has been hectoring Powell and his fellow Federal Open Market Committee officials, in increasingly belligerent terms, to cut rates to lower financing costs for the government’s ever-burgeoning debt load. Trump insists the Fed could save taxpayers some $800 billion by aggressively lowering its overnight funds rate, which currently sits at 4.33%.Powell and his predecessors have repeatedly held the line that the public fiscal situation does not and will not play a role in rate decisions. Veering outside the traditional Fed decision-making parameters would pose further questions for the next chair’s credibility.Advantages and disadvantages“The real loser here is not Jay Powell but his successor,” Perkins wrote. “We don’t even know who that person is, and already there are strong doubts about their integrity and what sort of ‘deal’ they have made to secure the position. But it seems pretty clear that Powell’s replacement will come with a ‘tacit understanding’ to cut rates.”To be sure, central bank experts acknowledge that there is some benefit to Trump wanting to get ahead of the game in naming the next Fed chair.Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026, so nominating a replacement perhaps a few months early would give the prospective nominee the chance to get through the Senate confirmation process and bone up on the myriad responsibilities that the position carries.But Trump’s idea is different.Such a “shadow chair,” under the market’s understanding and in conjunction with statements that Trump and his lieutenants have made on the matter, would be in place almost explicitly to undermine Powell. Should Powell not budge on pushing for rate cuts, the shadow chair could simply make public statements contrary to that position.However, finding a candidate to fill that role might not be so easy considering the reputational risks.“From the perspective of the nominee, there’s nothing good about being nominated far out in advance and being expected to serve as a shadow Fed chair. That can only end poorly,” said Lev Menand, an associate professor of law at Columbia Law School and author of the 2022 book, “The Fed Unbound: Central Banking in a Time of Crisis.”“It could lead to reputational harm. It could lead to pressure on you to say or do things in the run up to actually taking office that you don’t want to say or do,” he added. “It could lead to your nomination being yanked. It could lead to all sorts of bad things. So there’s nobody who’s seeking the Fed chair job who’s going to want to be put up early, except someone who’s told you won’t otherwise get it.”Markets might not like itTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been mentioned prominently as a potential Powell replacement, along with several others.In an Oct. 9, 2024, interview with Barron’s, less than a month before Trump’s election victory, Bessent said, “You could do the earliest Fed nomination and create a shadow Fed chair.” In such a case, “no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore.”How financial markets would react to such a scenario is unclear. However, Wall Street is notorious for disliking uncertainty, especially with something as sensitive as monetary policy.The last time the Fed cut rates, in late 2024, stocks rose but so did Treasury yields while the dollar fell. Rate cuts on the scale Trump is seeking — 2 percentage points or even more — could stoke inflation fears and send Treasury yields higher again.“A good case could be made for nominating the next Fed chair a few months before the handover in May 2026,” Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a recent note. “But nominating the next Fed chair now with the expectation that this person would be an active alternative voice on monetary policy for the best part of year would confuse the market, making it harder for the Fed to shape rate expectations and potentially ... in ways that would not help advance rate cuts.”Trump has a further set of logistics to navigate as he pushes his desire for lower rates.Rate cuts aren’t certainThere is only one upcoming vacancy on the board of governors, with Adriana Kugler’s term up at the end of January 2026.Powell’s time as chair runs out in May 2026, but he can stay on as governor until 2028. In the past, most Fed chairs have stepped down after the time at the helm ended; should Powell not go that route, he would then force Trump to name a current sitting governor as his successor, eliminating presumptive candidates such as Bessent, former Governor Kevin Warsh and current National Economic Council leader Kevin Hassett.Moreover, the chair is just one voter out of 12 on the Federal Open Market Committee. While there currently are disparate views from policymakers on how quickly rates should come down, there are no members who have indicated they support the kind of cuts Trump seeks.Investors will get a further peek into the Fed’s thinking when minutes of the June FOMC meeting are released Wednesday.“This is all somewhat unprecedented how things would develop,” Menand said. “But I think that it’s safe to say that depending on how it’s rolled out, it could really ultimately unsettle expectations and change how some of these dynamics unfold in the fall.”Markets expect the Fed will start cutting again in September, but the path from there is unclear. Should Trump name the shadow chair in the fall, it comes with the risk of both unsettling markets, and of causing problems for whomever he picks.“Depending on who it is, it could have no effect, really at all, on Powell’s ability to govern for the remainder of his term, or it could actually be quite disruptive,” Menand added. “What would actually happen if the person was named in advance?

What they're saying: ""The survey underscores the Federal Reserve's fear that the bulk of the tariff-induced inflation has yet to hit,"" KPMG economist Diane Swonk said in a statement.""The personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's favored inflation measure, is forecast to peak above 4% in the second half of 2025; that is more than double the Fed's 2% target.""The intrigue: Earnings season for public companies kicks off next week, and investors will be closely watching to see whether — and how badly — corporate profits are being squeezed. KPMG's data may serve as an ominous warning of what's to come.The bottom line: The government's already collecting nearly $30 billion a month in tariff revenue — and big companies seem to be paying the bill.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/09/trump-tariffs-margins,politics,
2025-07-09 09:00:00,AI is changing the world faster than most realize,"The people building AI are saying — subtly and unsubtly — that the technology is advancing more rapidly than the vast majority of people realize.Why it matters: It’s likely we won't know how and how much AI will change the way we live, work and play until it already has.""The internet was a minor breeze compared to the huge storms that will hit us,"" says Anton Korinek, an economist at the University of Virginia. ""If this technology develops at the pace the lab leaders are predicting, we are utterly unprepared.""Zoom in: Pay attention to what the people closest to the technology are saying.“[T]he 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before. We do not know how far beyond human-level intelligence we can go, but we are about to find out,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a recent blog post.Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, told Axios’ Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years.Geoffrey Hinton, one of the ""godfathers of AI,"" told BBC Radio 4 the technology is moving ""very, very fast, much faster than I expected.""Case in point: Take ChatGPT. It took five days after launch for the chatbot to hit 1 million users.It took Facebook 10 months to get to 1 million users, and it took Twitter, now X, two years to hit the same milestone.Between the lines: Despite those forecasts, few appear to be taking the AI tsunami seriously enough.""In the face of ginormous uncertainty, one of the most common reactions is to wait and see,"" Korinek, who sits on Anthropic's Economic Advisory Council, an unpaid position, says. ""That's a pretty hazardous approach.""""This is a very speculative technology, and the systems we have now are clearly subhuman in a number of areas,"" he says. ""But we’ve seen them improve rapidly in the past couple of years. So if you extrapolate, it seems like these systems could have superhuman intelligence in the next few years.""There are already signs that change is coming — fast. CEOs are starting to say ""the quiet part out loud” when it comes to how AI will hit employment, The Wall Street Journal reports.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees he expects the tech giant’s workforce to shrink.Ford CEO Jim Farley said at this year’s Aspen Ideas Festival, “Artificial intelligence is going to replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.”Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke told employees that before requesting to open a new role for hiring, they must first prove that the job cannot be done using AI.The majority of U.S. managers recently surveyed by Resume Builder say they're using AI at work. Many are using it to make hiring, firing and promotion decisions, Axios' Megan Morrone reports.Even more people could be supervised by AI as the technology replaces more and more middle managers.It’s not just at work — teachers and professors across America are overwhelmed by AI’s march into the classroom.Generative AI is fueling a cheating surge, but there’s no consensus on how to stop it. Banning the technology isn't a great solution, as students need to learn how to use it effectively and safely before they graduate.A January 2023 survey, just two months after ChatGPT's launch, found that nearly 90% of college students had already used it for assignments, New York Magazine reports.Reality check: The prediction that AI will upend society is still just a prediction. Yann LeCun, Meta's chief AI scientist and another ""godfather of AI,"" posted on X in February, ""A house cat has way more common sense and understanding of the world than any LLM.""CEOs have a vested interest in making bold claims about AI and its impact. It's a signal to investors and Wall Street that they're leading tech's next wave, Axios' Emily Peck reports.Still, even if AI froze in place right now — which would be next to impossible — its capabilities are already advanced enough to shake up our jobs and lives.What to watch: Amid fears of vanishing jobs and failing schools, there's still a case for optimism. Humans have adapted to technological change for centuries and could do it again.""We could derive enormous productivity gains. Our economy could produce so much more,"" UVA's Korinek says. ""This technology has the potential to lead to much more broadly shared prosperity. That’s what we should aim for.""",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/09/ai-rapid-change-work-school,politics,

2025-07-10 14:00:53,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang could soon be richer than Warren Buffett—he's worth $142 billion now,"Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang is now nearly as rich as longtime billionaire Warren Buffett — and could even soon surpass the Oracle of Omaha, in terms of net worth.Huang, 63, has a $142 billion net worth — including a $27.6 billion increase since January 1 — according to a Bloomberg estimate on Wednesday evening. Much of his wealth comes from his roughly 3.5% stake in Nvidia, which is currently the world’s most valuable public company.Nvidia’s market cap briefly passed $4 trillion on Wednesday, making it the first to ever reach that benchmark, and its stock is up roughly 22%, year-to-date. In the technology industry’s artificial intelligence arms race, Nvidia’s computer chips have become valuable components for multiple leading AI developers.The company currently has a market cap of $4 trillion. Its market valuation could peak near $6 trillion, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah said in a client note on Wednesday, according to Forbes.DON’T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakesBuffett’s $144 billion estimated net worth has also grown since January 1 — by $2.19 billion, according to Bloomberg. His conglomerate holding company Berkshire Hathaway has performed well in 2025 — its stock is up approximately 5%, year-to-date — but given Nvidia’s growth rate, Huang could soon overtake Buffett on the list of world’s richest people.Buffett, 94, has also given away some of his wealth. He recently donated $6 billion to five different charities, and has now given over $60 billion of his fortune away over the past two decades — a number that’s “substantially more than my entire net worth in 2006,” Buffett announced in a press release on June 27. (Buffett’s net worth that year was $46 billion, and he was the world’s second-wealthiest person, behind Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to Forbes.)Of course, Huang’s net worth isn’t guaranteed to surpass Buffett’s. Despite Nvidia’s year-to-date stock growth, the business has experienced large market swings in both directions in 2025.Nvidia’s shares dropped 17% in one day on January 27, after a report that Chinese AI lab DeepSeek used reduced-capacity chips from Nvidia to power its then-new language model, sparking panic in investors. It was the biggest single-day drop for a U.S. company in history, with Nvidia losing almost $600 billion in market cap, CNBC reported at the time.The company’s stock then fell 9% in one day on March 3, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, where the company hosts a portion of its manufacturing. But the company has been on a winning streak on Wall Street since June, perhaps a sign that investors’ concerns have quelled — at least, for now.Huang co-founded Nvidia with fellow engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993, when he was just 30 years old. None of them had never run a company before, which may have worked in their favor, Huang told the “Acquired” podcast, in an episode that aired on October 15, 2023.“If we realized the pain and suffering, just how vulnerable you’re going to feel, and the challenges that you’re going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don’t think anybody would start a company,” said Huang.“I think that’s the superpower of an entrepreneur,” he added. “They don’t know how hard it is, and they only ask themselves, ‘How hard can it be?'”Are you ready to buy a house?

2025-07-10 14:00:11,"Trump loses appeal of $5 million E. Jean Carroll sexual abuse, defamation verdict","Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang is now nearly as rich as longtime billionaire Warren Buffett — and could even soon surpass the Oracle of Omaha, in terms of net worth.Huang, 63, has a $142 billion net worth — including a $27.6 billion increase since January 1 — according to a Bloomberg estimate on Wednesday evening. Much of his wealth comes from his roughly 3.5% stake in Nvidia, which is currently the world’s most valuable public company.Nvidia’s market cap briefly passed $4 trillion on Wednesday, making it the first to ever reach that benchmark, and its stock is up roughly 22%, year-to-date. In the technology industry’s artificial intelligence arms race, Nvidia’s computer chips have become valuable components for multiple leading AI developers.The company currently has a market cap of $4 trillion. Its market valuation could peak near $6 trillion, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah said in a client note on Wednesday, according to Forbes.DON’T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakesBuffett’s $144 billion estimated net worth has also grown since January 1 — by $2.19 billion, according to Bloomberg. His conglomerate holding company Berkshire Hathaway has performed well in 2025 — its stock is up approximately 5%, year-to-date — but given Nvidia’s growth rate, Huang could soon overtake Buffett on the list of world’s richest people.Buffett, 94, has also given away some of his wealth. He recently donated $6 billion to five different charities, and has now given over $60 billion of his fortune away over the past two decades — a number that’s “substantially more than my entire net worth in 2006,” Buffett announced in a press release on June 27. (Buffett’s net worth that year was $46 billion, and he was the world’s second-wealthiest person, behind Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, according to Forbes.)Of course, Huang’s net worth isn’t guaranteed to surpass Buffett’s. Despite Nvidia’s year-to-date stock growth, the business has experienced large market swings in both directions in 2025.Nvidia’s shares dropped 17% in one day on January 27, after a report that Chinese AI lab DeepSeek used reduced-capacity chips from Nvidia to power its then-new language model, sparking panic in investors. It was the biggest single-day drop for a U.S. company in history, with Nvidia losing almost $600 billion in market cap, CNBC reported at the time.The company’s stock then fell 9% in one day on March 3, after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, where the company hosts a portion of its manufacturing. But the company has been on a winning streak on Wall Street since June, perhaps a sign that investors’ concerns have quelled — at least, for now.Huang co-founded Nvidia with fellow engineers Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993, when he was just 30 years old. None of them had never run a company before, which may have worked in their favor, Huang told the “Acquired” podcast, in an episode that aired on October 15, 2023.“If we realized the pain and suffering, just how vulnerable you’re going to feel, and the challenges that you’re going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don’t think anybody would start a company,” said Huang.“I think that’s the superpower of an entrepreneur,” he added. “They don’t know how hard it is, and they only ask themselves, ‘How hard can it be?'”Are you ready to buy a house?

2025-07-11 15:05:00,Education Department To Resume Interest Accrual On 7.7 Million Student Loan Borrowers,"Education Department To Resume Interest Accrual On 7.7 Million Student Loan Borrowers Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times,The U.S. Department of Education announced it will restart interest accrual for student-loan borrowers in the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, starting from Aug. 1, according to a July 9 Education Department (ED) statement.Launched in 2023 by the Biden administration, the SAVE plan calculated student loan payments based on the individual’s income and family size. The plan prevents interest from getting accrued, brings loan payments for those who earn less than $32,800 annually to zero per month, while providing early forgiveness for low-balance borrowers.In June last year, a federal court blocked parts of the SAVE plan. As a result, student loan borrowers enrolled in the plan had their loans put in forbearance with a zero percent interest rate. The SAVE plan was struck down as illegal by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in February.In April, a federal court issued an injunction to implement the decision made by the appeals court. The latest action by the ED was taken in order to comply with the court injunction.The department will start charging interest rates from Aug. 1. The interest will not be assessed retroactively, the department said.Interest will begin accruing from Aug. 1, when borrowers under the SAVE plan will see their loan balances grow. And when the SAVE forbearance period ends, borrowers will have to start making repayments on the loan, including the accrued interest, according to the ED.Starting July 10, the department will begin direct outreach to 7.7 million borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan, providing instruction on how to move to a legal repayment plan.“For years, the Biden administration used so-called ‘loan forgiveness’ promises to win votes, but federal courts repeatedly ruled that those actions were unlawful,” said Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. “Congress designed these programs to ensure that borrowers repay their loans, yet the Biden administration tried to illegally force taxpayers to foot the bill instead.”“Since day one of the Trump Administration, we’ve focused on strengthening the student loan portfolio and simplifying repayment to better serve borrowers.“As part of this effort, the Department urges all borrowers in the SAVE Plan to quickly transition to a legally compliant repayment plan–such as the Income-Based Repayment Plan. Borrowers in SAVE cannot access important loan benefits and cannot make progress toward loan discharge programs authorized by Congress.”In its last days in office, the Biden administration forgave more than $600 million for 4,550 borrowers under the income-based payment plans.“The Administration leaves office having approved a cumulative $188.8 billion in forgiveness for 5.3 million borrowers across 33 executive actions,” an ED statement said at the time. It has since been taken down.The Biden administration’s zero percent “litigation forbearance” forced American taxpayers to foot the bill, while leaving borrowers without clear direction on how to legally repay their loans, the Education Department said in its latest statement, adding that the Trump administration will support borrowers in selecting a new, legal repayment plan.The Biden administration announced the SAVE Plan just weeks after the Supreme Court blocked the Education Department from unilaterally waiving federal student loans.According to the ED, 42.7 million borrowers currently owe $1.6 trillion in student debt.“Only 38 percent of borrowers are in repayment and current on their student loans,” the ED said in April.“Most of the remaining borrowers are either delinquent on their payments, in an interest-free forbearance, or in an interest-free deferment. A small percentage of borrowers are in a six-month grace period or in-school.” Tyler DurdenFri, 07/11/2025 - 11:05",zerohedge,https://www.zerohedge.com/personal-finance/education-department-resume-interest-accrual-77-million-student-loan-borrowers,business,

2025-07-11 14:44:48,Strategist flags 'very unusual' Trump admin loyalty tests on CNN,"With the FBI now ramping up the use of lie detector tests to gauge loyalty to its new director, Kash Patel, one former White House official is slamming the move as “very unusual,” sparking a fierce clash with a Republican strategist on CNN.“You take an oath to the Constitution, you take an oath to serve the American people, you don't take an oath to who the FBI director is, so it is very unusual in my experience,” said Meghan Hays, Democratic strategist and former White House director of message planning under former President Joe Biden.While lie detector tests are not outside the norm at the FBI, several current and former employees told The New York Times that lie detector tests are now being used to determine whether senior staff have ever made disparaging remarks about Patel. According to the report, several FBI employees have retired or been forced out amid heightened scrutiny over their loyalty.Melik Abdut, a Republican strategist, defended the practice, and characterized it as just another way the Trump administration is “rooting out the deep state within government.”“We saw during the first Trump administration (that) there were Trump officials – people that Donald Trump appointed himself – who were penning anonymous op-eds, talking about their dissatisfaction with the president of the United States instead of resigning,” Adbdut said.“...So in this case, yes, I think that if you have a problem with your boss, or if you're on record disagreeing with your boss, then I think that's something that your boss or the agency needs to know, so I don't have a problem with what the FBI is doing in this sense.”Pushing back on Abdut’s comments, Hays argued that loyalty tests, when administered to determine allegiance to a particular law enforcement official, were simply a bridge too far.“I think that the difference here is political appointees are different than federal law enforcement agencies in who you take your oath to, and I think if you want to root out people who are not loyal to you as the president being a political appointee, that is one thing,” she said.“But these are federal law enforcement agents, and they are not there to serve a president there, they are there to serve the Constitution and the American people, so that is the difference in this instance.”Watch the video below or use this link here.",rawstory,https://www.rawstory.com/fbi-trump-very-unusual/,politics,

2025-07-12 16:50:00,Tucker Carlson Reveals Who He Thinks Funded Jeffrey Epstein's Crimes,"Tucker Carlson Reveals Who He Thinks Funded Jeffrey Epstein's Crimes Via VigilantFox.comJust this Friday night, Tucker Carlson named who he believes really FUNDED Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes.HINT: It wasn’t Epstein.What he said is guaranteed to make many in Washington furious. And there’s no taking it back now.On Tuesday, Tucker Carlson delivered two theories on why Pam Bondi won’t release the Epstein Files.Theory #1 was “Trump is involved.”But Carlson thought this explanation was not very likely.Then came Theory #2, which was that Carlson believed “intel services are at the very center of this story—US and Israeli—and they’re being protected.”“I think that seems like the most plausible explanation,” Carlson said.“And we have every right to ask on whose behalf was he working? How does a guy go from being a math teacher at the Dalton School in the late 70s with no college degree to having multiple airplanes, a private island, and the largest residential house in Manhattan? Where did all the money come from?” Carlson asked.Then came the big claim.“And no one has ever gotten to the bottom of that because no one has ever tried. And moreover, it’s extremely obvious to anyone who watches that this guy had direct connections to a foreign government. Now, no one’s allowed to say that that foreign government is ISRAEL because we have been somehow cowed into thinking that that’s naughty,” Carlson said.“There is nothing wrong with saying that,” Carlson continued. “There is nothing hateful about saying that. There’s nothing anti-Semitic about saying. There’s nothing even anti-Israel about saying that.”Friday night, while speaking in front of a live audience at a Turning Point USA event in Tampa, Florida, Carlson came to a conclusion.He boldly said he believes foreign intelligence was behind the Epstein blackmail operation.But which country?SPOILER ALERT: He named Israel.... pic.twitter.com/GsLBZBeGLA— The Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) July 12, 2025Someone who agrees with Carlson’s assessment is CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou.On Wednesday, he told the story of the recruitment of a copy machine repairman who earned his CIA operational officer a big promotion.At first, Kiriakou laughed at the notion of a copy machine repairman being useful, but then he realized the brilliance of the plan when he learned that the repairman secretly sent every document from a prime minister’s office straight to the CIA.How did he do it? By planting a tiny device on the copy machine.This flow of information was pure leverage for the CIA:“You know what they’re thinking. You know their next move. You know who their enemies are and who their allies are. Maybe it’s their position on trade negotiations. Maybe the prime minister has a health problem you need to plan for. You never know what might come through,” Kiriakou explained.“That ONE critical nugget is all it takes.”That, he says, is EXACTLY what Epstein was to Israeli intelligence: someone with access (like the copy machine repairman) who quietly delivered leverage on the world’s elite.Someone who agrees with Carlson’s assessment is CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou.On Wednesday, he told the story of the recruitment of a copy machine repairman who earned his CIA operational officer a big promotion.At first, Kiriakou laughed at the notion of a copy machine... pic.twitter.com/N0zbZ80U03— The Vigilant Fox 🦊 (@VigilantFox) July 12, 2025Back to Carlson. He addressed the claims that he’s taking money from the Qatari government head-on.What was his reaction to this claim? He literally laughed out loud.“Maybe I was taking tons of money from some bad country. One of the bad countries you’re not allowed to talk about or like—Qatar!” Carlson said before bursting into laughter.“That’s the most hilarious [claim]. Qatar is kind of controlling our conversation. Qatar. Evil Qatar,” he mocked.An audience member asked if Carlson was laughing, and he confirmed, “I am laughing.”“I’ve actually been to Qatar. It’s awesome. Never taken a dollar from the Qataris or the Qataris or whatever they’re called. Great country. But even if I was, like, on the payroll of Qatar, which I guess I’m like—I can’t now. But even if I was [taking money], it still wouldn’t make the question any less relevant. Why is this [war with Iran] a good idea?” Carlson asked.“And their refusal to answer that question lets you know right away that you are not dealing with a person of good faith. You’re dealing with a propagandist who is trying to control you.”Back to Carlson, he addressed the claims that he’s taking money from the Qatari government head-on.What was his reaction to this claim?

2025-07-12 17:09:16,Young Democrats have called for a rebrand. They're vying to replace the party's old guard,"Deja Foxx celebrated her April birthday in a way most 25-year-olds don’t. The extra candle meant she was now eligible to represent Arizona in Congress, and Foxx marked the occasion with a fundraiser.She’s part of a wide-ranging group of young Democratic candidates, many running to replace older incumbents, who have grown restless waiting for their turn to lead their party back to power.After a crushing 2024 election loss, they say the party desperately needs a rebranding — and young leaders should steer it.In southern Arizona on Tuesday, Foxx is one of several Democrats hoping to step into a deep blue seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Raúl Grijalva, a longtime political power broker in Tucson. He had become one of the most senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill over two decades in Congress. Grijalva’s daughter, Adelita, is one of the contenders, and three Republicans are vying in the GOP primary.But the push for younger leaders won’t end there. In next year’s midterm elections, primary challengers have already begun to emerge in states like California and Indiana that will give Democratic voters choices between longtime lawmakers and younger candidates.In Georgia, for example, 80-year-old Democratic Rep. David Scott’s decades-long legacy could end with a primary he’s expected to join. This has drawn challengers fed up with his refusal to step aside despite years of concern about his declining health and rare public appearances. The primary got crowded almost a year after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election race amid similar scrutiny over his age.Challenging well-connected candidates can be daunting, but progressive leaders say the moment calls for urgency.“Passing of the torch implies the leaders are handing it off,” said Amanda Litman, head of a group called Run for Something that bolsters progressive young candidates. “What we’re seeing right now is, the new generation is taking the torch. They’re not waiting for it to be passed.”Campaigning onlineMany Boomer and Gen Z candidates alike have largely abandoned the traditional playbook of spending millions on TV ads in favor of TikTok and social media. But it’s a pivot that older political hands would recognize from an older playbook: meeting voters where they are. Foxx, a digital strategist, led influencer strategy for Kamala Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign bid. On TikTok, she speaks to nearly 400,000 followers, saying she’d be the first woman of “our” generation elected to Congress. In 2022, Florida voters elected the generation’s first congressman — Democratic Rep. Maxwell Frost. The Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, which Frost co-chairs, has endorsed Adelita Grijalva. Foxx has leaned into popular Gen Z internet slang in branding her district tour “Crashout or Congress.” “Does the news make you feel like you’re about to crash out? Be honest,” Foxx posted.Foxx said her campaign turned a corner after a primary debate in late May, when some clips of her performance drew the eyes of millions and helped spark a fundraising boost.If Scott seeks another term in his suburban Atlanta district, he’ll face several candidates in the Democratic primary next May, including microbiologist and state Rep. Jasmine Clark, 42; state Sen. Emanuel Jones, 66; and 33-year-old Everton Blair, former chair of the state’s largest school district. Scott’s campaign did not respond to requests for an interview.Clark racked up 7,000 TikTok followers after a popular influencer reposted her. She occasionally pops in with solutions to people’s problems on NextDoor and is sometimes recognized as a podcast host instead of a state representative. She says Republicans have done a better job at saturating social media with their messaging.“Instead of looking at Republicans and wagging our fingers at them, we could take some lessons from them,” she said. DemocratsJun 29Zohran Mamdani says ‘I don't think we should have billionaires'Democratic PartyJun 25What Zohran Mamdani's rise in New York City means for the Democratic Party nationallyNewsJun 21Republican Party has nearly five times more cash on hand than the DemocratsMessage or messenger?Voters have been crushed by high living costs, Clark said, but Republicans, not Democrats, have been the ones to tell people their pain is real — even though Democrats have better ideas for fixing things.Blair agreed that Democrats have better policy prescriptions for addressing voters’ economic concerns, but he said too many longtime lawmakers have stifled the party’s ability to get that message across. He said President Donald Trump is fattening the wallets of billionaires but cheating low- and middle-income voters “out of the American dream.”“We have an incumbent who is just not doing the job, and we need a better fighter,” Blair said. “The stakes are just too high.”Young people have grown up in a political climate dominated by algorithms, said 21-year-old Akbar Ali, first vice chair of the Democratic Party in Gwinnett County, home to some of Scott’s district. That gives them a built-in understanding of how information spreads today, he said, but doesn’t replace on-the-ground outreach to voters of all ages. He said Scott’s physical absence is palpable, both in the community and as a voice in Congress. “A lot of people are upset on a national level because we can’t hit back with enough vigor,” he said.Adelita Grijalva carries a household name in Tucson and is regarded as the front-runner. Former state lawmaker Daniel Hernandez, who is credited with helping save then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords’ life after an attempted assassination over a decade ago, is also in the mix of Democrats.To Foxx, Grijalva benefits from her “legacy” last name.Grijalva, who has received several endorsements, including from Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, has pushed back. She said she brings her own credentials to the table. Her father was progressive and antiestablishment, and she said she is, too. But Foxx, who benefited personally from some government programs the Trump administration has slashed or is looking to slash, said Democrats need to do more to reach new voters.“We are bringing people into this party, into this democracy, who have felt left out — by and large young people and working-class folks,” Foxx said.A positive visionIn New York City, 33-year-old Zohran Mamdani recently won the mayor’s race with an upbeat campaign that leaned heavily on TikTok and emphasized finding new ways to make city life more affordable. In an era where so many young people doubt they’ll ever be better off than their parents, they’re increasingly willing to ditch pragmatism for bold policy platforms, said David Hogg.Hogg was removed from his leadership role with the Democratic National Committee, which said his election broke party rules. His decision not to run again followed his push to oust long-serving Democrats in safe congressional seats. He has not backed away from his vow to primary “asleep-at-the-wheel” Democrats with fresher faces.People of all ages want a fighter who understands what’s at stake as Trump cuts Medicaid and other programs that millions of Americans rely on, Hogg said. That’s why his political action committee, Leaders We Deserve, endorsed Foxx.Young voters were key to Democratic wins in recent years, but some swung to the right as Trump made gains in 2024. Hogg said he’s looking for candidates to “win them back” by talking about how change happens. Older candidates can do that too, he said, but for better or worse, young people aren’t yet “jaded” by politics.“In this dark moment, we need people who can provide us a general sense of hope, as crazy that can feel sometimes,” Hogg said. “To believe that maybe things won’t be as screwed up as they are now forever.”___Kramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

2025-07-12 17:00:12,Climate change helped fuel heavy rains that led to devastating Texas flood,"Officials are reporting more than 100 fatalities, including children and camp counselors.By Arcelia Martin for Inside Climate NewsHeavy rains last weekend that pushed the Guadalupe River in Texas’ Hill Country to its second-highest height on record had by Tuesday resulted in more than 100 reported deaths, including 27 children and counselors from Camp Mystic. But as search and rescue teams and volunteers sweep the banks of the river for missing people, the number of confirmed deaths is expected to grow.Climate scientists said the torrential downpours on July 4 exemplify the devastating outcomes of weather intensified by a warming atmosphere. These disasters, they said, will become more frequent as people around the world continue to burn fossil fuels and heat the planet.Related | The Texas flash flood is a preview of the chaos to come“This is not a one-off anymore,” said Claudia Benitez-Nelson, a climate scientist at the University of South Carolina. Extreme rainfall events are increasing across the U.S. as temperatures rise, she said.Warmer temperatures allow for the atmosphere to hold more water vapor, producing heavier rainfalls, she and other climate scientists said. This coupled with old infrastructure and ineffective warning systems can be disastrous.“It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in particular for temperature extremes,” the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2021. “At the global scale, the intensification of heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in the maximum amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold as it warms about 7% per 1°C of global warming.”The U.S. government’s fifth National Climate Assessment, released in November 2023, says that “the number of days with extreme precipitation will continue to increase as the climate warms” and that “these changes in precipitation patterns can lead to increased flood hazards, impacting infrastructure, ecosystems, and communities.” First responders from College Station Fire Department search along the banks of the Guadalupe River on July 6.Central Texas is infamous for its flash flooding and arid soil, hard-packed ground into which water does not easily infiltrate. So when rain hits the ground, it runs off the region’s hilly terrain and canyons and accumulates into creeks and rivers rapidly, overwhelming them, causing them to rise quickly.The flash flooding wasn’t a result of a full-strength storm, Benitez-Nelson said, but a remnant of a tropical storm. “That, to me, is really sad and deeply alarming,” Benitez-Nelson said. “Climate change is turning ordinary weather into these disasters.”Damp remnants of Tropical Storm Barry moved up from eastern Mexico as humid air also moved north from Mexico’s southwestern coast, stalling over Texas’ Hill Country. The warm air in both the low and high levels of the atmosphere is a recipe for intense rainfall, said John Nielsen-Gammon, the state’s appointed climatologist for more than 20 years.He and his colleagues compiled a list of all the rainfall events in Texas that produced more than 20 inches of rain a few years ago. One common feature the climatologists found was when wind blew from south to north, or when moisture was brought northward from the tropics, he said. “That sets up the possibility of very heavy rainfall,” Nielsen-Gammon said. He concluded in a report last year that extreme rain in Texas could increase 10 percent by 2036.Increased moisture from the tropics is driven by warming oceans.The oceans absorb over 90 percent of excess heat in the atmosphere produced by greenhouse gas emissions, warming ocean temperatures down to depths of 2,000 meters. Tropical storms gain strength from heat and evaporate more quickly at higher temperatures, adding more water vapor to the atmosphere, Nielsen-Gammon said.A study released Monday by ClimaMeter, a project funded by the European Union and the French National Center for Scientific Research, found that meteorological conditions leading up to Friday morning’s floods were warmer and 7 percent wetter than similar events of the past. Natural variability alone can’t explain the changes in rain associated with the exceptional weather, the report said, and points to human-caused climate change as one of the main drivers of the event.Related | Trump and Texas point fingers as flood death toll risesClimaMeter’s analysis shows the difference in surface temperature, precipitation and wind speed between the present climate from 1987 and earlier decades, from 1950 to 1986.“Climate change loads the dice toward more frequent and more intense floods,” said Davide Faranda, one of the report’s authors who is research director of climate physics in the Laboratoire de Science du Climat et de l’Environnement, part of the French National Center for Scientific Research. “The flash flood that tore through Camp Mystic at night, when people were most vulnerable, shows the deadly cost of underestimating this shift.”He added: “A 7 percent increase of rain is a lot, but doesn’t really make the tragedy. If you have a good alert system, if the population knows the risk related to climate change for this weather phenomena and can take them into account, not minimize them, then you can save lives, because it’s not double the amount of precipitation, it’s not three times. It’s something that we can handle if we are prepared.”Other factors in the flooding death toll such as land use change, urban sprawl and warning system failures weren’t analyzed and may have further amplified the disaster, the report said.“We are in a more extreme climate,” Faranda said. “And every year, year after year, we make it more extreme by burning more fossil fuels. ... These extremes now start to touch the limits of what is normal life on this planet, in terms of humans, in terms of infrastructure that we built with the old climate, in terms of resilience of the ecosystem.”Initial estimates for the damage and economic loss of this disaster will reach beyond $18 billion, according to AccuWeather.Staff writer Bob Berwyn contributed to this report.",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/12/2332890/-Climate-change-helped-fuel-heavy-rains-that-led-to-devastating-Texas-flood,politics,

2025-07-13 15:30:12,Trump issues executive order targeting 'unreliable' clean energy options,"The order reiterates measures included in the recently passed budget reconciliation bill, leading renewable energy advocates to question its significance.By Dan Gearino for Inside Climate NewsPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order on July 7 that he said will “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources” such as wind and solar.But it’s not clear whether the order will have much of an effect other than to underscore the president’s antipathy for those power sources. Some observers speculate this action is fulfilling a promise to hardline conservative House members in order to win their votes last week for the massive budget reconciliation bill.The order is titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.” It directs the Treasury department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits” as specified by the bill.Related | Trump thinks 'windmills are killing our country'—yes, reallyThe legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, says that projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027. This is a rapid phaseout compared to the previous law that had a phaseout that was to begin in 2032.The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines. It also says the department must take prompt action to follow the bill’s new limits on tax credits going to entities with ties to China.In addition, it says the Department of the Interior must revise any policies or practices that give solar and wind power preferential treatment compared to other energy sources.A solar array atop a parking structure in Scottsdale, Ariz., in Jan. 2015.The Treasury and Interior departments also must make reports within 45 days about how they are complying with the order.Analysts, lawmakers and officials from renewable energy industry groups had mixed reactions about the significance of the order.But they do not downplay the effects of the bill that has become law. It is a gutting of incentives from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that will reduce federal government support for renewable energy, electric vehicles and manufacturing of those products and related components. The result, according to reports from Rhodium Group, Princeton University’s REPEAT Project, the think tank Energy Innovation and the Clean Energy Buyers Association, is likely to be a decrease in U.S. jobs and an increase in electricity prices.And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email. “To state the obvious, only Congress can change tax law—which, in fact, is what Congress did last week via the budgetary megabill.”He expects little or no practical effect from the Interior department provision“It is worth noting that, under the Federal Power Act, the government cannot favor one type of power generation over another,” he said. “Thus, the EO simply restates existing law in that regard.”Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate for BloombergNEF, sees much greater potential for harm to the wind and solar industries.“It’s a big deal, but how big a deal it is we don’t know,” he said.He explained that the order is attempting to create uncertainty around the 2026 deadline, which is a crucial deadline for projects to have a smooth path to qualifying for tax credits.“It could push a lot of projects out of eligibility or into such an uncertain state of eligibility that it becomes hard to build and finance them,” he said.Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, offered this statement:“This executive order appears to target long-standing and well-established tax standards that allow for realistic financing timelines for all sorts of energy projects—including solar, wind, carbon capture and hydrogen projects,” she said. “We will continue to make the case that business certainty, predictability, and even-handedness are bedrocks of federal policy that cannot be undone by the stroke of a pen. We expect the Treasury Department to follow the law.”xDatawrapper ContentRep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois), who has a background running clean energy businesses, said the order is about helping the market for fossil fuels by harming competing sources of electricity.“Donald Trump doesn’t hate renewable energy because it is clean,” he said in an email. “He hates it because it’s cheap. His latest executive orders are about making it harder for Americans to access cheap and reliable energy to ensure he keeps profits up for his friends in the fossil fuel industry.”Taylor Rogers, an assistant press secretary for Trump, pushed back on concerns that the president’s actions would lead to higher energy prices.“No one takes disingenuous cost concerns seriously from ‘clean energy’ groups that supported a $200 billion tax hike on the American people to fund the Green New Scam,” she said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill will continue to unleash America’s energy industry, dropping electricity costs that increased dramatically due to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.”She listed the many aspects of the bill that increase oil and gas production and reduce regulations, which she said will cut costs for consumers.Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.The budget bill passed the House on Friday, 218-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. Several fiscally conservative House members initially balked at the spending levels in the bill, but most of them ended up voting for it after meeting with Trump.Related | We're getting coal, whether we want it or notAsked about how Trump had earned their votes, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told CNBC on Friday that the president had told members he would use executive powers to stop renewable energy sources from being able to use subsidies.“A lot of these subsidies won’t remain in effect from here on out,” Norman said.He posted on Facebook on Tuesday that the order was “a pledge [Trump] had made, and one he kept.”He added, “I proudly support an all-of-the-above energy approach—ensuring coal, gas, nuclear, hydropower, and yes, responsibly advanced renewables can compete in an honest market. THIS is how you make energy policy work for everyday Americans, not special interests.”It’s not much of a stretch to see a connection between Norman’s comment on CNBC and the executive order, said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that works to expand access to rooftop solar.“I assume that this is the direct response to that promise,” he said.He said it’s difficult to predict the ramifications of the order without knowing how federal agencies will choose to respond.“It all depends on how Treasury interprets the guidance. It could be nothing. It could be a lot,” he said.Brand believes the order’s intent was to increase uncertainty and discourage companies from using the tax credits, which it may succeed in doing even if it doesn’t lead to any substantive changes in the way the credits work.",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/13/2332936/-Trump-issues-executive-order-targeting-unreliable-clean-energy-options,politics,

The data also comes ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country’s central bank later in July.Singapore’s economy grew at 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, avoiding a technical recession as it reversed the 0.5% contraction recorded in the first three months of the year.On a year-over-year basis, the country’s economy expanded 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, accelerating from 4.1% in the first three months and beating expectations. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 3.5% growth.A technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarter-over-quarter declines in a country’s GDP. Analysts polled by Reuters had estimated a 0.6% quarter-over-quarter growth.The GDP growth was led by the manufacturing sector, which expanded 5.5% year over year, up from 4.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The sector makes up about 17% of the country’s economy.Despite the GDP beat, Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry said in its release that “there remains significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy in the second half of 2025 given the lack of clarity over the tariff policies of the U.S.”Back in April, MTI had downgraded the country’s GDP growth to 0%-2%, down from its previous forecast of 1%-3%. Singapore recorded a full-year GDP growth figure of 4.4% in 2024.Unlike other countries in Southeast Asia that have been hit with “tariff letters,” Singapore has not received such a “letter” from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, Singapore still faces the baseline 10% tariff from the U.S., despite running a trade deficit with the U.S. and having a free trade agreement since 2004.Singapore’s economic resilience task force, set up in April in response to the U.S. tariffs, announced last week that it will roll out grants to help businesses cope with the impact of global trade tensions.The GDP release also comes ahead of a monetary policy decision by the country’s central bank later in July.In its May meeting, the Monetary Authority of Singapore loosened its policy for a second straight time, saying that “there are downside risks to Singapore’s economic outlook stemming from episodes of financial market volatility and a sharper-than-expected fall in final demand abroad.”The MAS also warned that a more abrupt or persistent weakening in global trade will have a significant impact on Singapore’s trade-related sectors and, in turn, the broader economy.Nonetheless, the country’s inflation numbers are supportive of a rate cut.Singapore’s headline inflation rate fell to 0.8% in May, its lowest level since February 2021, while core inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, came in at 0.6% in May, compared to 0.7% the month before.",necn,https://www.nbcboston.com/news/national-international/trump-unprecedented-second-state-visit-uk-september/3765704/,politics,

2025-07-13 15:00:06,Caster Semenya's sex eligibility battle has confounded sports for 16 years—and still isn't over,"One of the most complex current issues in sports can be traced back to a track meet in Germany in 2009, when an unknown 18-year-old from South Africa blew away a field of the best female runners on the planet to win the world title. The teenager was hardly out of breath when she flexed her muscles at the end of it.What quickly became clear is that sports faced an unprecedented dilemma with the arrival of Caster Semenya.Caster Semenya sits in the European Court of Human Rights before its decision over sex eligibility rules in sports on July 10 in Strasbourg, eastern France.Now a two-time Olympic and three-time world champion in the 800 meters, the 34-year-old Semenya has been banned from competing in her favored event since 2019 by a set of rules that were crafted by track authorities because of her dominance.They say her natural testosterone level is much higher than the typical female range and should be medically reduced for her to compete fairly against other women.Semenya has refused to artificially alter her hormones and challenged the rules claiming discrimination at the Court of Arbitration for Sport court in Switzerland, then the Swiss Supreme Court and now the European Court of Human Rights.A ruling Thursday by the highest chamber of the European court — Semenya's last legal avenue after losing at the other two — found that she was denied a fair hearing at the Swiss Supreme Court.It kept alive Semenya's case and reignited a yearslong battle involving individual rights on one hand and the perception of fairness in sports on the other, with implications across the sporting world.A complex issueSemenya is not transgender and her case has sometimes been inaccurately conflated with that of transgender athletes. She was assigned female at birth, raised as a girl and has always identified as female.After years of secrecy because of medical confidentiality, it was made public in 2018 that she has one of a number of conditions known as differences of sex development, or DSDs. They are sometimes known as intersex conditions. Semenya was born with the typical male XY chromosome pattern and female physical traits. Her condition leads to her having testosterone levels that are higher than the typical female range.Caster Semenya competes in the Women's 800m race during the Prefontaine Classic in Stanford, Calif., in June 2019.World Athletics, the track governing body, says that gives her an unfair, male-like advantage when racing against other women because of testosterone's link to muscle mass and cardiovascular performance. It says Semenya and a relatively small number of other DSD athletes who emerged after her must suppress their testosterone to below a specific level to compete in women's competitions.The case has transcended sports and reached Europe's top rights court largely because of its core dispute: Semenya says the sports rules restrict the rights she has always known as a woman in every other facet of life and mean she can't practice her profession. World Athletics has asserted that Semenya is “biologically male.""How the rules workTrack and field's regulations depend on the conclusion that higher testosterone gives rise to an athletic advantage, though that has been challenged in just one of the many complicated details of Semenya's case.To follow the rules, DSD athletes must suppress their testosterone to below a threshold that World Athletics says will put them in the typical female range. Athletes do that by taking daily contraceptive pills or using hormone-blocking injections and it's checked through regular blood tests.Track first introduced a version of its testosterone regulations in 2011 in response to Semenya and has made them stricter over the years. The current rules require athletes affected to reduce their testosterone for at least two years before competing and throughout competitions, effectively meaning elite DSD runners would be constantly on medication to stay eligible for the biggest events like the Olympics and world championships.That has troubled medical experts and ethicists, who have questioned the “off-label” use of birth control pills for the purpose of sports eligibility.Semenya is not aloneWhile Semenya is the only athlete currently challenging the regulations, three other women who have won Olympic medals — Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi, Margaret Wambui of Kenya and Christine Mboma of Namibia — have also been sidelined by the rules.The issue came to a head at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when Semenya, Niyonsaba and Wambui won the gold, silver and bronze medals in the 800 meters when the rules were temporarily suspended. Supporters of the ban cited that result as evidence they had an insurmountable advantage over other women.World Athletics is now considering a total ban on DSD athletes like Semenya. Its president, Sebastian Coe, said in 2023 that up to 13 women in elite track and field fell under the rules without naming them.What Thursday's decision meansCaster Semenya and her lawyers on July 10 after their partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights in her seven-year legal fight against track and field's sex eligibility rules.Track's DSD rules became a blueprint for other sports like swimming, another high-profile Olympic code that has regulations. Soccer is considering testosterone rules in women's competitions.Sex eligibility is a burning issue for the International Olympic Committee and new president, Kirsty Coventry, who was elected in March. It was brought into urgent focus for the IOC after a sex eligibility scandal erupted at last year's Paris Olympics over female boxers Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan.Most sports will watch the direction of Semenya's case closely as it is sent back to the Swiss Supreme Court, and possibly to sport's highest court, even though that could take years. The ultimate outcome — whether a victory for Semenya or for World Athletics — would set a definitive precedent for sports because there has never been a case like it.",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/13/2332902/-Caster-Semenya-s-sex-eligibility-battle-has-confounded-sports-for-16-years-and-still-isn-t-over,politics,

2025-07-13 14:55:03,"Trump could potentially fire Fed's Powell over building renovations, Hassett says","President Trump could possibly fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell over questions about the renovation of Fed facilities, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday.Why it matters: The administration's relentless efforts to get Powell to either cut interest rates or leave have called the future independence of the central bank into question.The mere threat of firing Powell caused a sell-off in markets earlier this year that sent interest rates soaring. Trump said as recently as Friday he won't fire Powell, but Hassett's comments appear to crack the door open again. Catch up quick: The administration has ramped up pressure on the Fed over cost overruns for its headquarters renovation project, which Hassett said on ABC's ""This Week"" was $700 million over budget. On Thursday, Office of Management and Budget head Ross Vought sent Powell a letter demanding answers to a series of questions about those overruns and project changes, and whether they complied with the law. Fed watchers see the building issue as an administration effort to build a case to oust Powell for cause. What they're saying: ""I think whether the president decides to push down that road or not is going to depend a lot on the answers that we get to the questions that Russ Vought sent to the Fed,"" Hassett told ABC. Asked if Trump has the authority to fire Powell, Hassett said: ""That's a thing that's being looked into, but certainly, if there's cause, he does."" The intrigue: Hassett is widely seen as a leading contender to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chair expires in May.What to watch: Vought's July 10 letter gives Powell seven business days to respond, which takes him through the end of this week.That would potentially give Trump time to attempt action before the next Fed meeting, which starts July 29.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/13/trump-powell-federal-reserve-hassett,politics,

He accused the EU of imposing various tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers on the United States and said he would increase the tariff level if Europe retaliates.Trump had initially given U.S. trading partners until July 9 to negotiate trade deals with his administration or face the tariffs he announced in early April. Trump recently said he would begin sending letters to countries informing them of their tariff levels if they do not negotiate deals with his team.He has sent letters to more than 20 U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which received a letter on July 12 informing the nation that it would also have 30 percent tariffs imposed on its imports into the United States.After Trump announced the EU’s new tariff level, von der Leyen said on July 12 that the EU, the United States’ largest trading partner, would take all necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including “the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.”German Economy Minister Katherina Reiche called for a “pragmatic outcome to the negotiations” between the EU and the United States.EU ambassadors met on July 13, one day ahead of the trade ministers’ meeting in Brussels, to decide whether to retaliate against Trump’s new tariffs or extend a suspension on countermeasures that was set to expire on July 14.The EU opted to take the second route.While speaking with reporters, von der Leyen said the suspension would extend until early August while the EU continues to “prepare further countermeasures” so it is “fully prepared.”When Trump delayed the imposition of his reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners until July 9, the EU also suspended an initial package of countermeasures to U.S. sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminum that would affect $24.6 billion in U.S. imports into Europe.The EU was also preparing a second package of countermeasures since May that would target roughly $84.2 billion of U.S. goods, but the final list requires approval by all EU member states and has not yet been made public.The bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument, which allows it to retaliate against nations outside of the EU that put economic pressure on member states to alter their policies, was not yet on the table, von der Leyen said.“The [anti-coercion] instrument is created for extraordinary situations, we are not there yet,” she said.Among the possible retaliatory steps the EU could take are restricting its market access to goods and services and other economic measures that include export controls, financial markets, and foreign direct investment.On July 13, German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said the EU must take action against the United States if trade negotiations fail.“If a fair negotiated solution does not succeed, then we must take decisive countermeasures to protect jobs and companies in Europe,” Klingbeil, who is also vice chancellor in his nation’s ruling coalition, told German media. “Our hand remains outstretched, but we will not go along with everything.”Because the United States is its largest export market, Germany could face significant challenges from higher U.S. tariffs, particularly as it exports automobiles, automobile components, machinery, and pharmaceuticals into the United States.

2025-07-14 06:37:54,These 10 states are America's best for quality of life in 2025,"Vanguard has launched eight actively managed fixed-income ETFs. While the majority of ETF assets remain in passively run index strategies, it’s been a big year for active ETF launches, in both the bond and stock market.Actively managed exchange-traded funds are having a moment, but it’s not going to be a passing fad. This year alone, a record number of ETFs have been introduced, with 288 new funds and the potential for over 1,000 new ETFs by this year’s end, many bringing actively managed strategies from the traditional mutual fund world to ETFs. There are currently more than 2,000 active ETFs, and while they only make up about 10% of total ETF market assets, they have taken in over one-third of the flows this year from investors and reached the $1 trillion mark in total assets this year. ETF experts say as more major fund companies add actively managed portfolios, it will help to shape the ETF industry’s long-term future. Case in point is the biggest index fund company of all, Vanguard. Vanguard has launched eight active fixed-income ETFs. Roger Hallam, Vanguard global head of rates, cites these strategies in being integral for generating repeatable returns for clients.“We’re very focused on delivering bottom-up security selection to ensure that our alpha generation is as high information as it can be, so that we deliver repeatable returns for our investors over the investment cycle” Hallam said on a recent CNBC “ETF Edge” segment.The Vanguard ETFs include an ultra-short treasury ETF (VGUS), a 0-3 month T-Bill ETF (VBIL), a short duration bond ETF (VSDB), and a long-term tax exempt bond ETF (VTEL) amongst others.ETF experts caution that there is a big difference between adding active strategies to add return potential around a portfolio core of index holdings and becoming market timer, with the latter still a mistake too many investors make when markets are volatile. Active fixed income strategies have allowed managers to be more surgical in approach to a bond market which has faced high and atypical levels of volatility, and in light of the fact that the big traditional index from the bond market, the AGG, is considered by many bond experts to be out of date in its composition (the same would not be said of the S&P 500 for stocks). In the equities space, some of the newest active approaches are designed to limit risk in the stock market rather than ratchet risk up. Amid a year which already experienced one huge market drop, it’s important for investors to not over-correct based on short-term swings in performance. But active strategies make sense in ETFs, according to BlackRock‘s U.S. Head of Equity ETFs Jay Jacobs, for reasons that go beyond the recent bond and stock market volatility.“You’ve seen hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into ETF models that are scalable, repeatable, and cost efficient. And increasingly those models are adding active strategies to introduce new sources of alpha for their clients. So, there’s a lot of tailwinds,” he said, adding that the tax-efficient nature of buying and selling within ETFs is another benefit contributing to the adoption of active ETFs.“Previously, strategies that maybe were harder to access, or there was investment minimums, or the tax efficiency meant they could only be used by institutions that were tax advantaged, that has largely gone away with active ETFs” Jacobs said. “The world has shifted a lot in the last few years,” he added.The ETF experts also say that investors may seek more return generation from active approaches if the last decade of market returns proves to be unrepeatable. The ultra-low interest rate policies from the Federal Reserve which boosted the performance of the stock market in particular are not expected to return, and that has implications for what investor can expect from their core holdings. The shift to more of these active strategies marks not only a significant change in how asset managers are tweaking their ETF portfolio lineups, but in how investors are approaching the market.

2025-07-14 05:05:56,Historic Grand Canyon lodge destroyed as wildfires force evacuations in northern Arizona,"The Grand Canyon Lodge was among ""numerous"" historic structures to burn as two wildfires in northern Arizona triggered evacuations amid hot, dry and gusty conditions, officials said Sunday.The big picture: Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs (D) on Sunday demanded an investigation in regards to the Dragon Bravo Fire that razed the historic lodge in the Grand Canyon National Park, noting on X that ""the federal government chose to manage"" that blaze that started with a lightning strike ""as a controlled burn during the driest, hottest part of the Arizona summer."" Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said on X she wants ""a comprehensive and independent investigation"" into the fire's management ""and a report detailing the decisions that led to this devastating outcome."" Screenshot: Hobbs/XParts of the Grand Canyon National Park were closed until further notice due to the Dragon Bravo Fire, according to a National Park Service post.By the numbers: The fire that ignited in the area of the North Rim in Grand Canyon National Park on July 4 was burning out of control over some 5,000 acres as of Sunday night, per Inciweb, an interagency website that tracks wildfires.The nearby White Sage Fire that began after a July 9 thunderstorm had grown to nearly 40,200 acres at 0% containment, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Threat level: Among the structures destroyed or damaged in the Dragon Bravo Fire were a water treatment facility, ""numerous historic cabins"" and the only lodge at the North Rim, which had been in operation since 1937, per National Park Service posts.It was later confirmed that chlorine gas was released from the water treatment facility that caught fire and ""park authorities immediately evacuated firefighters from the North Rim and hikers from the inner canyon, and closed access to specific areas within the inner canyon,"" the NPS said.Fire activity ""intensified rapidly"" late Saturday, ""fueled by sustained winds of 20 mph,"" with gusts reaching up to 40 mph, per a Grand Canyon National Park Facebook post.""Firefighters made significant efforts overnight to slow the fire's progression under dangerous and fast-changing conditions,"" according to the post.Meanwhile, the White Sage Fire has prompted road closures and crossed Highway 89A near House Rock Valley, Ariz., the Bureau of Land Management's Arizona Fire Management said on X Sunday night.Firefighters tackling the blaze were facing ""very extreme fire behavior due to the dry conditions, gusty and erratic winds inhibiting the ability for fire fighters on the second night, to safely engage the fire,"" per a the U.S. Forest Service post.""The fire made a significant run on the afternoon of July 10, spotting, and torching due to sustained winds from 15-20 mph, fueled by extremely dry conditions, low relative humidity, and low fuel moistures. This very active fire behavior continued into the evening and into the early morning.""What we're watching: Gusty and ""erratic winds"" were possible in and around thunderstorms, the National Weather Service said in a Sunday forecast discussion.An extreme heat warning was expected to continue for the Grand Canyon below 4,000 feet through Wednesday evening ""due to high temperatures of 110-115F at those lower elevations,"" according to the NWS.Representatives for the Agriculture Department and U.S. Forest Service did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment on Hobbs' investigation calls.Between the lines: Research shows hot, dry and windy weather that helps wildfires spread is becoming more common across much of the U.S. amid climate change, per Axios' Alex Fitzpatrick.Here is a great shot of the Dragon Bravo Fire on the North Rim this morning. Not only is there dangerous heat at the lower levels of the Grand Canyon, but lots of smoke and high fire danger.

2025-07-14 03:19:34,Tragedy in Fall River: Read the full press release on Sunday's deadly fire,"Electricity prices are expected to surge higher throughout the next decade due to energy policy changes in President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful” bill, according to a new analysis from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate think tank.Signed July 4, the bill mandates expanded oil and gas leasing, caps clean energy subsidies and rolls back tax credits that helped to make wind, solar and other clean power cheaper for manufacturers and more affordable for consumers, says Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation. When the clean energy tax credits phase out at the end of 2025, that will bump up electricity costs for ordinary Americans, Orvis says. That’s largely because higher costs for clean energy development will slow the pace of new supply, just as U.S. energy demand hits record highs, he says, resulting in higher electricity bills and increased reliance on natural gas, which will also become more expensive with rising demand.How much energy costs could increaseElectricity costs in some states will go up more than others due to the budget bill’s provisions, Orvis says — particularly in states with the greatest future potential for clean energy development. Oklahoma’s windy conditions, for example, make the state a prime candidate for powering wind turbines, which has historically allowed residents to benefit from cheap, clean energy, Orvis says. But without the tax break for new wind power infrastructure, the average household electricity bill in the state will rise by $540 by 2035, according to Energy Innovation’s analysis.Overall, household energy costs will rise by $170, on average, by 2035, researchers found. And that estimate may be conservative. A report from Princeton University’s Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit pegs the average increase at $280 a year by 2035.What’s driving the price hikesEnergy Innovation’s report factors in the near dozen Biden-era clean energy incentives that Trump’s legislation terminates or phases out, along with a few clean energy policies the bill affects that predated former President Joe Biden’s administration, Energy Innovation says. It compares projected energy costs in 2035 under two scenarios: one where Trump’s budget bill passed, and one where it didn’t.The data accounts for changes in spending on all fuel types for powering homes and vehicles, including natural gas and gasoline, although most of the cost increases are related to electricity and natural gas, Energy Innovation says. The report did not include Alaska or Hawaii. Here’s how much more households in every state could pay annually, on average, by 2035, due to changes in energy policies under the “big beautiful” bill, according to Energy Innovation’s research. Alabama: $200 Arkansas: $430 Arizona: $220 California: $320 Colorado: $310 Connecticut: $150 Delaware: $150 Florida: $430 Georgia: $270 Iowa: $350 Idaho: $130 Illinois: $180 Indiana: $340 Kansas: $380 Kentucky: $630 Louisiana: $440 Massachusetts: $120 Maryland: $350 Maine: $80 Michigan: $320 Minnesota: $410 Missouri: $640 Mississippi: $200 Montana: $240 North Carolina: $490 North Dakota: $180 Nebraska: $250 New Hampshire: $110 New Jersey: $220 New Mexico: $220 Nevada: $320 New York: $170 Ohio: $190 Oklahoma: $540 Oregon: $140 Pennsylvania: $160 Rhode Island: $180 South Carolina: $630 South Dakota: $120 Tennessee: $190 Texas: $480 Utah: $320 Virginia: $250 Vermont: $100 Washington: $55 Wisconsin: $300 West Virginia: $160 Wyoming: $150Are you ready to buy a house?

It needs to be redeployed in a new way, and that’s what we did during this response,” Noem said in an interview on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” referring to the federal government’s response to the Texas floods.“It’s not just FEMA that can respond in these situations. The federal government has all kinds of assets, and we deployed them,” Noem added, pointing to the Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection helping with disaster response. Both groups routinely respond to disasters.Trump has slammed FEMA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, and mused about possibly “getting rid” of the agency, which administers emergency relief. Noem, too, has said the administration would eliminate FEMA.Asked on “Meet the Press” a second time whether Trump no longer wanted to end the agency, Noem reiterated that she believed the president “wants it to be remade so that it’s an agency that is new in how it deploys and supports states.”In the aftermath of the Texas floods, which have killed at least 129 people with 166 still missing, the administration has shifted away from its harsh rhetoric targeting the agency. Noem told reporters Saturday that the federal response in Texas would be how Trump envisions “what FEMA would look like into the future.”It’s a far cry from how the president has targeted the agency. Just days into his second term, he said, “FEMA has really let us down, let the country down.” That same day, Trump signed an order directing a “full-scale review” of FEMA.Central Texas FloodJul 12FEMA removed dozens of Camp Mystic buildings from 100-year flood map before expansion, records showCentral Texas FloodJul 10FEMA records show Texas' Kerr County didn't alert all cellphones as flooding beganCentral Texas FloodJul 9After Texas floods, questions about FEMA's future loom largeNoem also acknowledged reports from NBC News and other outlets that the secretary requires that she personally sign off on all agency spending over $100,000.“The $100,000 sign-off is for every contract that goes through the Department of Homeland Security,” Noem said.“It’s an accountability on contracts that go forward,” Noem added. “But there was no break in contracts. Those contracts were approved as soon as they were in front of me, and FEMA knew they were fully to deploy them the instant that the local officials asked for the request.”In the aftermath of the deadly floods, some Democrats have criticized the administration’s response, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., going so far as to say that Noem should resign.Noem responded to Warren on Sunday, brushing off the comment with a laugh.“I don’t care what she thinks,” Noem said, adding there was “no” chance she would resign.Gov. Andy Beshear, D-Ky., said later on “Meet the Press” that it was important “that we make sure that we learn from” the floods. He pointed to deadly floods in Kentucky, saying, “We asked every question after. We didn’t shy from anything.”“What I hope happens is people embrace the questions, because the questions don’t have to be a political football, and shouldn’t be,” Beshear said. “It’s: ‘How do we do better? How do we save more lives? How do we get a better weather forecast? Do we have enough people at the National Weather Service? Can we deploy faster than we did this time?’ All of those things are legitimate.”Noem calls ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ ‘secure facilities,’ not ‘jail cells’Noem on Sunday responded to criticism of what the administration is calling “Alligator Alcatraz,” an immigrant detention center in Florida. Some Democrats have criticized the center’s conditions, with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., calling them “really appalling.”Noem argued that standards at federal detention centers “are extremely high.” The “Alligator Alcatraz” facility is state-managed, which Noem acknowledged.Wasserman Schultz, who visited the facility with other Florida Democrats, said that detainees were “essentially packed into cages” that held more than 30 people each.“Wall-to-wall humans,” Wasserman Schultz said Saturday.ImmigrationJul 11Detained immigrants at ‘Alligator Alcatraz' say there are worms in food and wastewater on the floorImmigrationJul 3First migrants arrive at Florida's ‘Alligator Alcatraz' detention center, official saysImmigrationJun 30Trump toured Florida's immigration detention center in the Everglades. Here's what to knowNoem said she “wouldn’t call them jail cells,” adding, “I would call them a facility where they are held and that are secure facilities but are held to the highest levels of what the federal government requires for detention facilities.”The secretary said the administration is looking into establishing additional detention centers, and she encouraged people to “self-deport.”Noem’s comments also come one day after the administration faced a setback in deportation efforts in California. A federal judge ruled Friday that officials could not solely rely on a person’s race or spoken language in determining whether to detain them.Noem said she would comply with the judge’s order but denied that people are targeted solely for those factors. She said the administration would appeal the judge’s decision.“What we have always done is built a case and done investigative work in who we go after and who we target,” Noem said. Enforcement officials, though, also arrest people collaterally when other migrants are present during arrests.Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, acknowledged “collateral arrests in many areas” in a CNN interview Sunday but denied that law enforcement relied solely on a person’s looks in determining who to detain.“Let me be clear: Physical description can’t be the sole factor to give you reasonable suspicion,” Homan said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He said a person’s appearance could contribute to a decision over whether to detain someone, giving an example of someone with an MS-13 tattoo.This story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

2025-07-14 02:46:05,Live updates: Trump threatens Russia with tariffs if war on Ukraine isn't resolved,"Garrett Crochet has arguably been the best pitcher in all of Major League Baseball through the first half of the 2025 season, and he’s one of the primary reasons why the Boston Red Sox are going into the All-Star break as the hottest team. Crochet’s latest start came Saturday afternoon against the Tampa Bay Rays at Fenway Park. The Red Sox managed to score only one run, but that was enough for Crochet, who tossed his first career shutout. He gave up just three hits and zero walks, while striking out nine batters. It was one of many dominant performances he has given the Red Sox in his first season with the team.Crochet’s impact goes beyond his elite pitching on the mound, though. He’s also helping the team in a profound way off the field.Red Sox manager Alex Cora explained when speaking to reporters before Saturday’s game. “The leader, to be honest with you,” Cora said, per Tim Healey of The Boston Globe. “Every five days, we know he’s going to be on the mound. But what he’s doing in the clubhouse — you see him in the dugout, he’s always into the games and talking to pitchers. Yesterday, (Greg) Weissert came out, he didn’t like the slider, they were talking about grips and all that.“He’s very similar to Alex (Bregman) in that sense. Him and Walker (Buehler), well, Walker has more experience obviously, but he is very smart. With the contract (extension), stuff comes with the territory. You have to be that guy. We haven’t had a guy like that in a while. We’ve had some good ones throughout the years. Now that he is here, he is on the Red Sox, he’s doing an amazing job.”More Red Sox coverageBoston Red Sox16 hours agoRed Sox select Oklahoma pitcher with No. 15 pick in MLB DraftBoston Red SoxJul 11WATCH: Rafaela's walk-off HR gives Red Sox eighth straight winCrochet made his major league debut in 2020 and he’s only 26 years old. But you don’t have to be a 10-year veteran to be a respected leader. And, judging by what Cora said above, it sounds like Crochet has fully embraced the leadership role.This is a very encouraging development for a Red Sox franchise that has a lot of young players it’s trying to develop. One way to accelerate that development is to surround these talented young players with leaders who will set a good example on and off the field. That’s why it is so important to have guys like Bregman and Crochet around.The Red Sox have taken a 10-game win streak into the break, and as a result, they sit in the second wild card spot in the American League and trail the first-place Toronto Blue Jays by just two games in the AL East division race. However, the Red Sox have the toughest remaining schedule in the AL, per Tankathon, and they begin the second half of the season with series versus the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies and Los Angeles Dodgers.For the Red Sox to keep this momentum alive and secure a playoff spot for the first time since 2021, they’ll need Crochet to maintain his Cy Young-level performance. He doesn’t show any signs of slowing down, but he’s already pitched 129 1/3 innings, which is only 17 below his career high for an entire season. Can he stay dominant with a larger workload? Time will tell.This story uses functionality that may not work in our app. Click here to open the story in your web browser.",necn,https://www.nbcboston.com/news/politics/president-trump/trump-administration-europe-tariffs-immigration-fema-july-14-2025-live-updates/3765913/,politics,

2025-07-14 02:34:59,"Trump to announce ""aggressive"" Ukraine weapons plan","President Trump will announce a new plan to arm Ukraine on Monday that is expected to include offensive weapons, two sources with knowledge of the plans tell Axios.Why it matters: Sending offensive weapons would be a major shift for Trump, who had until recently been at pains to say he would provide only defensive weapons to avoid escalating the conflict. U.S., Ukrainian and European officials hope the weapons will shift the trajectory of the war and change Russian President Vladimir Putin's calculations regarding a ceasefire.Two sources told Axios they had reason to believe the plan was likely to include long-range missiles that could reach targets deep inside Russian territory, including Moscow. However, neither was aware of any final decision.""Trump is really pissed at Putin. His announcement tomorrow is going to be very aggressive,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Axios.Driving the news: The new initiative, which will be rolled out in a meeting between Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, will involve European countries paying for U.S.-made weapons that will be sent to Ukraine.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Behind the scenes: The scheme was proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during the NATO summit two weeks ago. U.S. and Ukrainian officials said the meeting between Trump and Zelensky at the summit was their best so far. ""Zelensky came like a normal human being, not crazy, and was dressed like a somebody that should be at NATO. He had a group of people with him that also seemed not crazy. So they had a good conversation,"" a U.S. official said. Zelensky wore a suit at the summit for the first time since 2022.The other side: Trump has grown increasingly frustrated over the last two weeks over Putin's unwillingness to move towards a ceasefire and Russia's escalating attacks on Kyiv and other cities.One thing that convinced Trump to move down this path was the July 3 phone call in which Putin made clear he planned to escalate the war. Putin indicated that over the next 60 days he would make a renewed push to occupy territory up to the administrative lines of the Ukrainian regions in which Russia has a significant foothold.""He wants to take all of it,"" Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron shortly after his call with Putin, according to a source with direct knowledge.In the ensuing days, the weapons plan turned from an idea to something more concrete.What he's saying: Trump told reporters Sunday evening that the weapons he would send Ukraine through European countries would include ""various pieces of very sophisticated military (equipment),"" including Patriot air defense batteries.Trump said European countries ""are going to pay us 100% for them. It is going to be business for us.""He added that he is ""very disappointed"" in Putin for saying he wanted peace and then escalating his attacks on Ukraine.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/14/trump-ukraine-weapons-missiles-russia,politics,

2025-07-14 02:10:43,Biden defends frequent autopen use at end of term,"Former President Biden insisted that he authorized the wide use of his signature via autopen at the very end of his presidency, according to a rare interview that the New York Times published Sunday evening.Why it matters: Senate and House Republicans and President Trump's Justice Department are conducting investigations into how Biden's aging affected his ability to be president.Some, particularly House Oversight Chairman James Comer, have been probing whether White House officials abused Biden's use of the autopen, which does not require the president's physical signature.Driving the news: ""I made every decision,"" Biden told the Times. He said he used the autopen on granting widespread clemency and pardons to particular groups because ""we're talking about a whole lot of people.""At the very end of his term, Biden took action to reduce jail time for almost 4,000 federal convicts.Many of those pardons and clemency actions were signed using an autopen–including those signed to pardon members of Biden's family, the Times reported.Zoom in: Emails the Times obtained show that after Biden met with senior aides on Jan. 19, the day before Trump's inauguration, the Democrat's chief of staff Jeff Zients emailed a larger group of aides and wrote: ""I approve the use of the autopen for the execution of all of the following pardons.""Biden told the Times, ""I made every single one of those. I understand why Trump would think that, because obviously, I guess, he doesn't focus much. Anyway, so — yes, I made every decision.""He and aides said Biden did not approve every individual categorical clemency, but he did hold extensive discussions on the matter before signing off on the criteria for them, according to the times.A Biden spokesperson declined to comment further.Comer told Axios in a statement: ""The House Oversight Committee will continue pursuing answers about this historic scandal to prevent such an abuse from happening again.""Between the lines: Biden's 10-minute interview with the is his first interview with the paper since he became president in early 2021.Biden's staff largely shielded him from the press as his ability to communicate declined in his old age, something that aides attributed to a stutter from his childhood.State of play: Current and former Biden aides have been interviewed by Comer's committee in recent weeks.Biden's presidential physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, refused to answer questions at his deposition last week as he invoked the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.What's next: Other senior aides are set to be interviewed in the coming weeks and Trump'The Trump White House has waived executive privilege that might allow some aides to decline answering particular questions.Go deeper: Biden Cabinet members worried about his capacity in a crisis, book says",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/14/biden-defends-autopen-use-white-house,politics,

""As a company committed to launching new therapeutic options which address the unmet needs of patients, adding LEQSELVI to our dermatology portfolio represents a key milestone for the business and an important advancement for the alopecia areata community.""With limited treatment options available to people living with severe alopecia areata in the U.S., the need for innovative therapies such as LEQSELVI remains critically important. LEQSELVI demonstrated rapid results in clinical trials with one third of patients regaining almost all of their hair by Week 24. Some patients (3%) achieved 80% or more scalp coverage as fast as 8 weeks.1""The clinical evidence for LEQSELVI is truly compelling, demonstrating consistent efficacy,"" said Arash Mostaghimi, MD, MPA, MPH, FAAD, Vice Chair of Clinical Trials and Innovation and Associate Professor of Dermatology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""LEQSELVI provides clinicians with an important new treatment that can deliver significant, rapid outcomes for patients with alopecia areata.""The psychosocial impact of alopecia areata can be significant. Many people living with severe alopecia areata face psychological distress, including loss of self-confidence, due to the unpredictable nature of hair loss, underscoring the importance of effective treatment solutions.2 A medication that works fast is critical for alopecia areata patients.5 In a recent survey, 83% of patients preferred a treatment with attributes that included speed. Fast regrowth brings back more than just hair.3,5""The availability of LEQSELVI offers hope to our community, delivering a new, effective treatment option for adults living with severe alopecia areata,"" said Nicole Friedland, President and CEO, National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF). ""NAAF is thrilled to see expanded choices and increased opportunities for individuals to find an FDA-approved treatment to address hair loss caused by this autoimmune disease.""LEQSELVI may cause serious side effects including serious infections, malignancies, thrombosis, gastrointestinal perforations, and certain laboratory abnormalities. There also may be an increased risk of mortality and major cardiovascular events. LEQSELVI should not be used in patients who are CYP2C9 poor metabolizers or who are taking moderate or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors. In placebo-controlled trials, the three most common adverse events were headache (12.4% as compared to 9.4% with placebo), acne (10% as compared to 4.3% with placebo), and nasopharyngitis (8.1% as compared to 6.7% with placebo). Please see full Prescribing Information Including BOXED WARNING and Medication Guide and see below for Important Safety Information.1 Sun Pharma is committed to making LEQSELVI accessible to patients through the LEQSELVI SUPPORTTM Program, which offers eligible patients the opportunity to receive their medication for as little as $0 for up to two years. The program also provides access to a dedicated Patient Access Liaison—someone who will guide patients through the process, answer questions, and offer personalized support every step of the way.

Greg Abbott is refusing to release months’ worth of emails between his office and right-wing billionaire Elon Musk, claiming that the contents are too “intimate or embarrassing” to share.That’s not a joke.According to a joint report from ProPublica, The Texas Newsroom, and The Texas Tribune, the correspondence spans from last fall to now and was requested under public records laws. Abbott’s office initially estimated it would take more than 13 hours to review the emails, and accepted a $244.64 processing fee. Then it suddenly changed course.Instead, the governor’s office argued the records were protected by “common-law privacy”—a legal doctrine that, as some attorneys say, is usually reserved for personal health information or details about minors, not conversations between elected officials and billionaires with big business interests in the state.“Section 552.101 encompasses the doctrine of common-law privacy, which protects information that is (1) highly intimate or embarrassing, the publication of which would be highly objectionable to a reasonable person and (2) not of legitimate concern to the public,” Abbott’s public information coordinator, Matthew Taylor, wrote in a letter to the Texas attorney general’s office.The letter went further, claiming the emails included “financial decisions that do not relate to transactions between an individual and a governmental body,” as well as privileged exchanges with lawyers, internal policy discussions, and information on how Texas courts major companies to invest in the state. Releasing them, Taylor warned, “would have a chilling effect on the frank and open discussion necessary for the decision-making process.” Then-President-elect Donald Trump listens to Elon Musk as he arrives to watch SpaceX's rocket Starship lift off for a test flight in Texas in November 2024.That might sound plausible—if it didn’t also seem like a dodge.“Embarrassment” is a strange excuse for hiding messages between one of the country’s most powerful Republican governors and the world’s wealthiest man. Musk’s companies are deeply involved in state policy, and Abbott has openly allied himself with Musk, promoting him as a symbol of Texas’s pro-business, anti-regulation stance.As ProPublica notes, the privacy exemption cited by Abbott’s office is rarely used to block records about high-profile government dealings. It’s usually invoked to hide things like medical records, not secret communications between public officials and politically connected billionaires.Musk’s SpaceX rocket company, for its part, also objected to releasing its communications, claiming the emails contained proprietary info and warning of “substantial competitive harm” if made public.Meanwhile, a recent Texas Supreme Court decision has made it even easier for state officials to avoid open records laws. And Abbott’s office still has not given a clear explanation for why these specific emails with Musk should stay under wraps.That only adds to the mystery.Records like these allude to Musk’s growing influence in Texas politics. Earlier this year, The Texas Newsroom published emails and calendar entries revealing that the tech billionaire’s company’s representatives met regularly with lawmakers who backed Musk’s priority bills. The outlet also found a letter from Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick to the Federal Aviation Administration, pushing for faster approval of SpaceX rocket launches.Since then, Musk’s Texas operations have expanded. Tesla, SpaceX, and X are now or will soon be headquartered in the state. Voters recently approved turning Starbase—SpaceX’s launch site in South Texas—into an official town. And as Musk has moved further right politically, Abbott and other Texas leaders have kept paving the way for his business ventures.So the real question isn’t whether the emails are embarrassing. It’s what, exactly, Abbott and Musk were discussing behind closed doors—and why they’re working so hard to hide it.",dailykos,https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/7/15/2333363/-What-on-earth-are-Elon-Musk-and-Greg-Abbott-emailing-about,politics,

2025-07-16 15:20:21,"What happens if Trump fires Fed Chair Powell: ‘This would be a mess,' analysts warn","The “Base App,” which replaces Coinbase Wallet, will combine wallet, trading and payment functions as well as social media, messaging and support for mini apps. The intent is to expand Coinbase’s reach to a new subset of consumers who aren’t necessarily interested in buying or trading crypto but could still reap the benefits of the so-called on chain economy. The Base App will run on Coinbase’s in-house built public blockchain, also called Base. In-app transactions will be powered by USDC.Coinbase unveiled Wednesday an “everything app” designed to bring more people into the crypto economy.The “Base App,” which replaces Coinbase Wallet, will combine wallet, trading and payment functions as well as social media, messaging and support for mini apps – all running on the company’s homegrown public blockchain network Base, which is built on Ethereum.So-called super apps like WeChat and Alipay – which bundle several different services and functionalities into a single mobile app – have long been viewed as the holy grail of fintech by the industry. They’re central to everyday life in China but haven’t been successfully replicated in the West. Meta Platforms and X have made attempts to realize that vision, integrating payments, messaging and social content, among other things.For Coinbase, the intent is to expand its reach to a new subset of consumers who aren’t necessarily interested in buying or trading crypto, the company’s core business. Over-reliance on that revenue stream has been a sticking point for the company, and some analysts view the Base blockchain as a way for it to drive utility in crypto beyond speculative trading.Until now, enthusiasm around the Base network has been confined to builders and developers keen to use the technology. In perhaps the highest profile example, JPMorgan said last month that it’s launching a so-called deposit token on the Base blockchain.Base is often touted for its ability to settle a payment in less than a second for less than a cent, which its fans expect will help the network grow in a way other crypto-based payments efforts haven’t.Now, Coinbase hopes to tap into an opportunity to settle payments on the Base network that go beyond trading and payments. With the introduction of the everything app, the company is emphasizing the opportunity for a new economic model for content creators in particular – one that might give them more direct and diverse monetization options for their content as well as more control over their identity and data.The new app will be powered by two key functions also being introduced: an identity verification system called Base Account and an express checkout system for payments with the Circle-issued USDC stablecoin, called Base Pay.Coinbase will fund creator rewards and waive USDC transaction fees within chats in the app as part of the effort to bring more users on chain. It is not expected to generate significant revenue right away.The new consumer app comes as the crypto industry and Coinbase, in particular, embrace a boom in product launches and rollouts thanks to the pro-crypto policies of the Trump administration and more clearly defined crypto regulations expected from Congress — perhaps as soon as this week. Last month Coinbase launched its first credit card with American Express and Shopify rolled out USDC-powered payments through Coinbase and Stripe.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has said both have a “stretch goal” to make USDC the number 1 stablecoin in the world, a position currently held by Tether’s USDT, and that he aims to make Coinbase “the number one financial services app in the world” in the next five to 10 years.

This statement comes as new research reveals significant readiness challenges across enterprise networks.""The convergence of AI and networking represents one of the most significant shifts we've seen in enterprise IT,"" said Brian McGahan, 4x CCIE and Director of Networking Content at INE. ""What many organizations don't realize is that successful AI implementations depend fundamentally on solid networking foundations. The protocols, architectures, and automation skills that we've been teaching for years are exactly what enterprises need to support AI workloads effectively.""A recent survey by Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) of 269 North American IT professionals found: Only 49% of respondents believe their data center networks are ready for AI traffic 48% believe their wide area networks are fully prepared for AI traffic. 74% of surveyed organizations have at least some AI applications in production.

Australia’s unemployment rate was expected to hold steady at 4.1% in June.Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was set to open lower, with the futures contract in Chicago at 39,545 while its counterpart in Osaka last traded at 39,540, against the index’s Wednesday close of 39,663.40.Futures for Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index stood at 24,576, pointing to a stronger open compared to the HSI’s last close of 24,517.76.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was also set to start the day higher with futures tied to the benchmark at 8,588, compared with its last close of 8,561.80.— Amala BalakrishnerU.S. futures slip following rally on Trump’s denial that he plans to fire PowellU.S. equity futures fell in early Asia hours after U.S. President Donald Trump denied his plans to fire Jerome Powell from his position as Federal Reserve chairman.S&P 500 futures lost 0.17%, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.18%.

2025-07-16 14:52:14,"Israel bombs Syrian capital despite U.S. pressure to ""stand down""","The Trump administration has asked Israelx to halt its strikes on Syrian government targets and to open direct talks with Damascus, a senior U.S. official told Axios on Wednesday.Why it matters: U.S. officials are highly concerned that the Israeli attacks — including on Syrian military headquarters in Damascus and near the presidential palace — could destabilize the new Syrian government.The official said the past 48 hours could seriously undermine progress toward a new security agreement between Israel and Syria as a first step toward normalization. Those discussions had previously been showing significant progress, the official said.Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that the U.S. was ""very concerned"" about the Israeli strikes in Syria and wants the fighting to stop.Behind the scenes: U.S. special envoy for Syria Tom Barrack conducted several calls on Tuesday and Wednesday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's top adviser Ron Dermer to push for deescalation.""We told the Israelis to stand down and take a breath,"" the senior U.S. official said, adding that the administration is pushing for direct talks between Israel and Syria to solve the crisis.Dermer's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Catch up quick: In recent days, there have been clashes between a Druze militia and a Bedouin gang in the city of Suwayda in southern Syria. There has been sporadic violence between members of the two minority groups since dictator Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December and replaced by ex-militant Ahmed al-Sharaa.When the Syrian government sent in tanks to try to restore order, the Israeli air force attacked those tanks. The U.S. official said Syria had notified Israel in advance about the tanks and said its response was not directed at Israel.But Israeli officials claim the tanks entered a zone that Israel, which is occupying parts of western Syria, has demanded be demilitarized of heavy weapons.Over the last 24 hours, clashes continued in Suwayda between the Druze, the Bedouins, militias affiliated with the Syrian government and Syrian security forces. According to the Syrian human rights observatory in London, at least 250 people have been killed.Driving the news: The leaders of the Druze community in Israel pressed the Israeli government to intervene, claiming militias affiliated with the Syrian government were carrying out a massacre of Druze in Suwayda.On Tuesday night local time and into Wednesday morning, Israel escalated its strikes against Syrian government targets in southern Syria and in Damascus.On Wednesday around noon local time, hundreds of Israeli Druze broke through the border fence with Syria in the Golan Heights and entered the buffer zone between the countries in an attempt to reach Suwayda.Israeli officials claim the strikes are intended to protect the Druze minority in Syria as part of its commitment to the Druze community in Israel, and that Syrian militias affiliated with the government have been killing dozens of Druze.However, the senior U.S. official said U.S. intelligence does not show any involvement of the Syrian government in atrocities in Suwayda. The U.S. official said that the Israeli government told the Trump administration it sees what happened in Suwayda as an Oct. 7 like attack on the Druze community.The U.S. official said Israel's actions are influenced by domestic political pressure from the Druze community in Israel — which comprises around 2% of the population — on the Netanyahu government.The latest: Despite the U.S. push for calm, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that it's sending reinforcements to the border with Syria to facilitate more strikes and stop the attacks against the Druze.""Israel will not allow a massacre of Druze in Syria,"" the statement says.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/16/israel-bomb-syria-trump-response,politics,2025-07-16

2025-07-21 09:30:01,"Bosses, stop trying to flatter your workers, says leadership expert—it doesn't make them like you","In a CNBC interview, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested for a review of the Federal Reserve that would go beyond the current controversy over building renovations and look at its overall function. The comments come amid an intensifying conflict between the White House and the central bank. Bessent backed the idea that the Fed probably should be easing with inflation mostly moderating.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday suggested a review of the Federal Reserve that would go beyond the current controversy over building renovations and look at its overall function.“What we need to do is examine the entire Federal Reserve institution and whether they have been successful,” Bessent said during an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “Has the organization succeeded in its mission? If this were the [Federal Aviation Administration] and we were having this many mistakes, we would go back and look at why has this happened.”The comments come amid an intensifying conflict between the White House and the central bank.Last week saw conflicting reports over whether President Donald Trump was preparing to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Reports from the White House indicated a move was forthcoming, but Trump soon after denied he is readying what would be a legally questionable maneuver.Bessent has been at the center of the controversy, both as a potential successor at the Fed as well as reports pointing to the Treasury chief as a mediator looking to discourage Trump from ousting Powell.“President Trump solicits a whole range of opinions and then makes a decision,” Bessent said when asked about a Wall Street Journal report that he had helped convince Trump to stay his hand on Powell. “So he takes a lot of inputs, and at the end of the day it’s his decision.”Trump has demanded the Fed dramatically lower its benchmark overnight borrowing rate, something that appears unlikely regardless of the chair.In addition, the administration in recent days has criticized the Fed for cost overruns at the $2.5 billion renovation it has undertaken for two of its buildings in Washington. Administration officials reportedly are planning soon to view the project in person.On the question of interest rates, Bessent backed the idea that the Fed probably should be easing with inflation mostly moderating.“They were fear mongering over tariffs, and thus far we have seen very little, if any, inflation,” Bessent said. “We’ve had great inflation numbers. So, you know, I think this idea [is] of them not being able to break out of a certain mindset. All these Ph.D.s over there, I don’t know what they do.”The Fed last cut rates in December, which completed a brief easing cycle that brought the fed funds rate down a full percentage point. However, as the Fed eased both mortgage rates and Treasury yields moved higher.Market pricing indicates the Fed probably will cut again in September.

This comes as Jackson had also pointed out in June that he was expecting the stock to soar over $100 apiece in the next 18 months.The SOTP method, as outlined by the X user, breaks down IREN's value into three key revenue streams: colocation, Bitcoin mining, and cloud service provision.The analysis assigns a $45.2 billion valuation to colocation, leveraging market comparables and a premium due to AI-driven demand, as inspired by insights from Gary Cardone‘s MiningPod interview with IREN CCO Kent Draper.Bitcoin mining contributes $2.1 billion, derived from a comparison with another mining company, CleanSpark Inc.

2025-07-21 09:16:29,Microsoft hit with SharePoint attack — one version still vulnerable,"U.S. Treasury yields were lower on Monday as investors weighed the state of the U.S. economy and considered the latest trade developments.The 10-year Treasury yield was more than 7 basis points lower at 4.362%. The 2-year yield was more than 2 basis points lower at 3.852%. The 30-year yield was 8 basis points lower at 4.919%.One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.On Monday, The Conference Board reported that its Leading Economic Index dropped 0.3% in June to 98.8. That was more than the Dow Jones forecast for a 0.2% fall.“At this point, The Conference Board does not forecast a recession, although economic growth is expected to slow substantially in 2025 compared to 2024,” Justyna Zabinska-La Monica, The Conference Board’s senior manager for business cycle indicators, said in a statement. “Real GDP is projected to grow by 1.6% this year, with the impact of tariffs becoming more apparent in H2 as consumer spending slows due to higher prices.”Investors will now keep an eye on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech on Tuesday morning, existing home sales data for June on Wednesday, weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday, and durable goods orders on Friday.The Fed is currently in a blackout period — a policy that limits Fed officials from speaking publicly ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week where monetary policy decisions will be made, including interest rate cuts. The blackout period began on Saturday.Investors are also monitoring the latest trade news. Over the weekend, the White House reiterated that countries must begin paying tariffs from Aug. 1. On Sunday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said it’s a “hard deadline,” but said countries can still negotiate the tariffs after that date.“Nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they’re going to start paying the tariffs on August 1,” Lutnick said.",nbcdfw,https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/money-report/microsoft-hit-with-sharepoint-attack-one-version-still-vulnerable/3889901/,business,

2025-07-21 09:32:19,"Altman plans D.C. push to ""democratize"" AI economic benefits","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will use a swing through Washington this week to argue that AI is already making Americans more productive — and to promise to keep AI ""democratic"" by getting it in as many hands as possible, sources tell Axios.Why it matters: Altman wants to continue driving debate over the effect AI will have on jobs. In an appearance Tuesday at a major Federal Reserve conference, Altman will offer what an adviser calls a ""third path"" between the bulls and the doomers.Democratized vs. concentrated: A source familiar with Altman's thinking told us in an exclusive preview that his vision is ""not all doomerism downside and not hand-waving away concerns — but focused on democratizing benefits (getting them into the hands of people to do stuff), not concentrating them in the hands of the few.""Democratic vs. autocratic: It'll be the economic counterpart to a geopolitical case Altman made one year ago this week. In a Washington Post op-ed, he wrote that a U.S.-led ""democratic vision for AI"" must prevail over authoritarian governments that are ""willing to spend enormous amounts of money to catch up and ultimately overtake us.""By the numbers: In data being reported here for the first time, OpenAI says ChatGPT users send more than 2.5 billion prompts each day globally. More than 330 million of those daily prompts are in the U.S.The free version of ChatGPT is used by the vast majority of the platform's more than 500 million weekly active users, OpenAI says. Zoom in: On Tuesday, Altman will join Michelle Bowman, the Fed's new vice chair for supervision, for a fireside chat at a bank regulation conference before an audience that includes Fed officials and Wall Street executives.A new economic analysis by OpenAI chief economist Ronnie Chatterji will be released in conjunction with Altman's Fed appearance.It's AI Week in D.C.: President Trump on Wednesday will keynote a ""Winning the AI Race"" summit, hosted by the All‐In Podcast and the Hill & Valley Forum.Also on Wednesday, the White House is expected to release its long-awaited 20-page AI Action Plan — which promises a hands-off, pro-growth approach, Axios tech policy reporters Maria Curi and Ashley Gold scooped last week.""Over the course of the week,"" the source told us, ""OpenAI will make the case that democratizing the economic benefits begins with putting these tools in the hands of people to do stuff so they have an opportunity to participate in the prosperity.""""OpenAI sees AI fundamentally as a productivity-driving technology,"" the source continued. ""The big question isn't if it will grow the economic pie — it's who gets how much of a slice. ... It's not about stopping disruption, but putting it into people's hands so they have the opportunity to benefit.""The big picture: Altman tweeted last week, in support of comments by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, that AI will allow people to ""do a lot more than they could do before; ability and expectation will both go up,"" although ""for sure jobs will be very different.""Altman added that ""maybe the jobs of the future will look like playing games to us today while still being very meaningful to those people of the future. (people of the past might say that about us.)""The bottom line: Altman wrote in an essay last month that the AI industry is building ""a brain for the world,"" and said that intelligence ""too cheap to meter is well within grasp.""Go deeper: Inside Trump's AI Action Plan.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/21/sam-altman-openai-trump-dc-fed,politics,

2025-07-21 09:30:02,There's one thing no one knows about Trump,"Every day, it seems, we see or hear about another way in which Trump and his lickspittles in Congress and the various federal agencies are tearing down our country, weakening our defenses, pitting Americans against each other, looting our government, and making life harder for everybody except the morbidly rich.The question nobody seems to have an answer to is, “Why?”Is it that, as Craig Unger seems to suggest, that he’s been a Russian agent for decades and is setting us up to lose to the newly-forming Axis of Russia and China?Is it that he spent so many years burning with rage and embarrassment at not being accepted by New York high society that he’s just come to hate America?Could it be that America-fearing foreign powers that have poured literally billions of dollars into the Trump family are paying him to tear us apart so they’ll never again have to endure the humiliation of having their human, civil, and women’s rights records called out by a future administration?Is it possible it’s all just to pay for tax cuts for billionaires?Or are his, JD Vance’s, and Elon Musk’s white supremacist, Christian nationalist, libertarian, and/or neo-Nazi ideologies so intense that they’re willing to essentially burn the country down just to expel people of color, elevate the rich, and re-subordinate women?These are serious questions for which I can’t find credible answers that explain the entire spectrum of their behavior. Why would Trump and the GOP:Condemn 12 million Americans to sickness and early death by gutting Medicaid?Destroy American soft power by killing USAID, thus condemning millions to death?Fire so many workers at the Social Security Administration that just getting through to sign up or get help has turned into a multi-day slog?Gut the State Department at a time diplomacy is most needed for world peace?End food assistance (SNAP) for millions when one-in-five American children experience hunger?Refuse to enforce laws and rules that allow workers to form unions in their workplaces?Propose forcing all new Medicare recipients onto Medicare “Advantage” corporate scam plans?Refuse military aid to Ukraine for seven long months and then give Russia 50 days to finish off their genocidal job?Stop the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from going after fraudsters and banks when they rip people off?Eliminate a major NOAA program designed to warn communities about the dangers of flooding and other extreme weather crises?Politicize the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Election Commission?End net neutrality so none of us are safe online?Shut down anti-cyber-warfare operations in the federal government?Defund university research that leads to innovation and saves lives?Cut unemployment insurance benefits across Red states?Terminate support for people with student loans and gut scholarship programs?Slash Affordable Care Act outreach budgets and allow junk insurance plans?Reverse over 100 environmental rules, including those on clean air, clean water, and chemical safety?Weaken Dodd-Frank, including gutting oversight of “too big to fail” banks and stress tests for mid-size financial institutions?Dial back OSHA workplace safety standards and inspections?Cut taxes to rich people while raising them via tariffs on working class folks?Change the Federal Trade Commission to allow more monopolistic, rip-off corporate behavior?Make it harder to vote and harass Blue states by demanding their voter information?Work to prosecute women who have miscarriages or abortions?Make it harder to qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)?End auto emission standards and increase our reliance on fossil fuels?Pack the courts with judges the American Bar Association says are “unqualified”?Destroy our faith in our elections and set up election workers for harassment?Fire the Inspectors General (who find waste, fraud, and abuse) across multiple federal agencies?Weaken whistleblower protections?Put the military on the streets of our cities in violation of Posse Comitatus?Use state power to punish political opponents and those who’ve investigated Trump’s crimes, alleged Russian collusion, and corruption?Create a network of concentration camps across America?Allow a shadow cabinet of billionaires and theocrats via Project 2025?Attack judges and prosecutors, leading to violence and threats of violence?Foment violence (like on January 6th) as a political strategy?Destroy our asylum and refugee systems?Pardon insurrectionists, rapists, cybercriminals, and other wealthy criminals?Defund the IRS so they can no longer audit the morbidly rich, leading to the loss of hundreds of billions in federal revenues?Ban books and censor libraries?Criminalize trans and queer people?Roll back gun safety measures?Defund the arts, humanities, and public media?Gut vaccine and other programs that keep Americans healthy?Nakedly politicize the military?Expand federal surveillance powers while kneecapping oversight?Criminalize free speech, particularly on college campuses?Attempt to revoke birthright citizenship?Attack press freedom and bar the Associated Press from the White House?Sabotage the US Postal Service?Undermine the census?Scale back civil and women’s rights enforcement?Normalize autocratic language like “vermin,” “scum,” and calling immigrants “animals”?Expel millions of brown-skinned immigrants who’ve already gone through the legal process to get work permits and are on a path toward citizenship?Create international fiscal chaos with an on-again, off-again TACO tariff policy?Cancel the suicide hotline for queer kids?Gut our national parks and sell off our federal lands to wealthy friends of the administration?Create a vast, secret, unaccountable police force with masked officers whose identity is concealed?Allow the president to accept hundreds of millions in obvioius bribes from foreign powers in violation of the Constitution?And this, of course, is just a partial list of the ways Trump and the GOP have weakened our nation, reduced our standing and prestige in the world, corrupted our government, and immiserated working class families.Many of the theories about why Trump and the GOP would enthusiastically do so much damage to our people, our military, and our democracy contradict others.For example, why would billionaires want tax cuts at the expense of damaging the economy that made them rich? Why would we promote a muscular military policy like bombing Iran while simultaneously destroying morale within the ranks and kneecapping our intelligence agencies?“Something is happening here but you don’t know what it is,” sang Bob Dylan back in the 1960s.Today, we’re there.Why do you think Trump and the GOP are working so hard to ruin our country?",rawstory,https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/donald-trump-2673367998/,politics,

2025-07-21 09:00:00,Wary Democratic establishment keeping New York's Mamdani at arm's length,"Zohran Mamdani, New York City's surprise Democratic nominee for mayor, is scrambling to woo lawmakers, donors, and the city's elite who are wary of the democratic socialist.So far, they're mostly playing hard to get.Why it matters: In their party's ongoing identity crisis, many Democrats have attacked or refused to endorse Mamdani to lead the nation's largest city, while others on the left have rallied around the 33-year-old political phenom.The schism over Mamdani is a version of the turbulence Democrats are wrestling with nationwide, as progressives and some party operatives are increasingly frustrated by snubs from the establishment.Driving the news: That divide was clear last week, when Mamdani visited D.C.Most Democrats on Capitol Hill kept their distance, but dozens of progressive members of Congress greeted him enthusiastically at a breakfast arranged by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow New Yorker.Democratic leaders Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer, both also from New York, have declined to endorse Mamdani. They've criticized his past refusal to condemn those who say ""globalize the intifada"" — a slogan that backs Palestinian uprisings against Israel and that some Jewish people see as antisemitic.Mamdani also has accused Israel of conducting a ""genocide"" against Palestine, another reason some Democratic leaders have kept their distance from him.Jeffries did meet with Mamdani in New York on Friday but declined to endorse him afterward.Some progressives and democratic socialists have responded by threatening to back primary challenges against Jeffries and other Democrats.Jeffries' team responded by calling such left-wing activists ""Team Gentrification,"" and that the House Democratic leader's response to any such challenge would ""be forceful and unrelenting,"" as Jeffries senior adviser André Richardson told CNN.Zoom in: Mamdani's plans to freeze rents for stabilized apartments, increase taxes, build city-owned grocery stores and provide free child care for all children — along with his criticisms of corporations and the police — have freaked out many Democrats close to the party's political center. To try to rally the party behind him, Mamdani is changing his rhetoric, bringing on experienced operatives, talking with the business leaders he wants to tax, and repeatedly talking about ""partnership.""His recent message boils down to: I come in peace.Mamdani said this week he'd ""discourage"" pro-Palestine protesters from using the term ""globalize the intifada,"" after repeatedly saying he wasn't interested in policing people's speech, as The New York Times reported. Mamdani also tried, with mixed success, to charm the city's business elite on Tuesday in a closed-door meeting with the Partnership for New York City — a group that includes representatives from big law firms and businesses.Mamdani, who in the past has called to ""defund the police"" and is now proposing a ""Department of Public Safety"" separate from the police department, is now signaling he's open to keeping the current police commissioner, who's widely viewed as tough on crime. He's also been adding operatives such as Jeffrey Lerner, the former political director of the Democratic National Committee, and political veterans in communications and other areas to add some experience to his young but passionate team.Flashback: Mamdani's reception by the party contrasts sharply with how Democratic leaders celebrated Mayor Eric Adams four years ago, after he won the Democratic primary.Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hosted Adams and invited him to speak before the Democratic caucus. Then-President Biden had him over to the White House.Between the lines: Some Democrats are worried about how Mamdani's rise in New York City has already set off Republican fear-mongering aimed at the entire Democratic Party.Some conservative critics are focusing on Mamdani being a Muslim who was born in Uganda, while others, such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, are calling him a ""communist.""What they're saying: Spokespeople for Mamdani and Jeffries did not respond to requests for comment.State of play: New York's Democratic establishment is paralyzed in part because there now are two Democrats running as independents in the Nov. 4 general election: Adams and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost to Mamdani in the Democratic primary.This week, Mamdani and Adams repeatedly took shots at Cuomo and his record as governor. Both see Cuomo as the biggest threat to their winning in November.Adams, who polls now find to be deeply unpopular, wants to try to drive Cuomo out of the race to get a one-on-one match-up with Mamdani.Bottom line: Mamdani is the front-runner in the heavily Democratic city, but some Democratic leaders are unsure he'll win — and for now, they don't want to risk aligning with him.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/21/zohran-mamdani-new-york-democrats-wary,politics,
2025-07-21 09:00:00,How Trump's game-planning for the 2026 midterms,"President Trump is already fixated behind the scenes on next year's midterm elections for the House and Senate — unleashing his billion-dollar political operation and personally burrowing into the minutiae of races.Why it matters: Now that his ""big beautiful bill"" has passed Congress, Trump's ability to accomplish more big things there — and avoid impeachment — hinges on keeping the GOP's razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress in his last two years in office.Zoom in: Even with all that's swirling around Trump — foreign conflicts, deportations, tariffs, the Jeffrey Epstein fallout — he's micro-level focused on 2026 races.One example: Trump's been particularly locked in on the already messy GOP Senate primary in Texas, where polls indicate Sen. John Cornyn is trailing scandal-plagued state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a longtime Trump loyalist.After Paxton's wife announced she was filing for divorce, White House insiders say, Trump — who hasn't endorsed in the race — was aware of it within an hour. He's been asking others about its political impact.Here's how Trump's team is laying the groundwork for 2026: 1. Money muscleTrump's biggest asset could be his enormously well-heeled political operation, for which he continues to aggressively raise money. Trump has told congressional Republicans he plans to spend heavily on their races.He's also planning to headline a big Republican National Committee fundraiser in D.C. this fall.Trump political lieutenants James Blair and Tony Fabrizio are slated to appear at an upcoming donor retreat to be held by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).Trump's operation will soon set up fundraising vehicles for candidates in several high-profile races to allow the Trump team to quickly raise money for them.2. Recruit aggressivelyThe White House is seeking candidates to run in several key races. Trump himself is expected to get involved if an on-the-fence prospect needs a push.Trump aides currently are trying to land a recruit in the race for New Hampshire's vacant Senate seat, for example.White House political director Matt Brasseaux has been attending House candidate recruitment meetings being organized by Georgia Rep. Brian Jack, a former Trump aide.3. Early redistrictingTrump is pushing for Texas Republicans to redraw the state's House districts five years early to create more GOP-friendly seats.That could net as many as five new GOP-held seats and dilute Democrats' voting power — but it carries risks.It almost certainly would face court challenges, and some Republicans worry that some of the party's incumbents could be endangered by shifting GOP voters to districts now represented by Democrats. It also could lead blue states to try the same thing to favor Democrats. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has threatened as much in that state. Democrats already outnumber Republicans in California's House delegation, 43-9. Trump urged members of Texas' congressional delegation to get on board with his plan during a call this week, and his team is eyeing other states for possible redistricting.4. Keep selling Trump's big billThe White House is drawing up plans to spend the next year-plus selling Trump's domestic policy mega-bill to voters. That won't be easy: Polls indicate the measure — which includes tax cuts and a range of cuts to social programs — isn't popular. Trump and his cabinet members plan to travel to battleground areas to promote provisions of the bill Trump's team sees as politically palatable. Last week, Vice President Vance touted the bill in eastern Pennsylvania. Fabrizio spoke to a small group of House Republicans a few days ago to offer guidance on messaging, and Blair recently addressed a Senate GOP lunch with Trump pollster David Lee.The White House is planning an August retreat for congressional staffers to discuss how to promote the bill.5. Stave off retirementsTrump is trying to use his political sway to persuade battleground Republicans from vacating their seats.Trump this month helped get Iowa Rep. Zach Nunn to seek reelection to his competitive district, rather than run for governor.The White House also is trying to keep Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst from retiring. Ernst drew fire — and a Democratic opponent — recently when she told a group of constituents, ""We all are going to die,"" in response to concerns about Medicaid cuts in Trump's megabill. But top Republicans worry her retirement would complicate their prospects of keeping the Republican-friendly seat. 6. Endorse — and attack — in primariesTrump plans to use his dominance over the GOP to shape primaries — either to ensure the party nominates who he sees as the most electable candidates for the general election, or to punish Republicans who've crossed him. He's endorsed more than a dozen House Republicans from swing seats to try to protect them from costly primary challenges, and is expected to endorse more.He recently met with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to discuss the state's Senate primary for the seat now held by Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. The White House is eager to avoid a bloody primary and is determining how to engage, similar to its wait-and-see posture in the Texas Senate primary.Trump's political operation has run a pair of ads targeting Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who was one of two House Republicans to vote against the megabill.What they're saying: ""The president understands that good politics makes even better policy and has embarked on ... a multidimensional effort aimed at expanding the House and Senate majorities,"" said Chris LaCivita, a senior Trump political adviser.",axios,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/21/trump-2026-midterms-congress-control,politics,
